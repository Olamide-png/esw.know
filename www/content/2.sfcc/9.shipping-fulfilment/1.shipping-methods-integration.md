The shipping methods displayed during ESW Checkout depend on the configuration of the ESW Override Shipping preference in ESW Checkout Configuration.

## Behavior

- When ESW Override Shipping is Enabled (Per Country)
 - The ESW Checkout API sends SFCC Standard Shipping Methods as overrides to ESW.
 - The shopper sees SFCC shipping methods at checkout.

- When ESW Override Shipping is Disabled (Per Country)
 - ESW retrieves the default shipping methods from the Checkout tenant configuration or database.
 - The shopper sees ESW-managed shipping methods at checkout.

## Displaying the SFCC Shipping Methods

The standard SFCC shipping methods are created with a specific currency. In the custom site preference, the ID of the shipping methods is mapped with a specific country. <br>

Follow the following steps to display the standard SFCC shipping methods at the ESW checkout.

::steps{:level="4"}

#### :smart-icon{name="streamline-ultimate-color:delivery-truck-clock" size=45} Create Standard Shipping Methods in SFCC  

- Navigate to **SFCC Business Manager → Merchant Tools → Ordering → Shipping Methods**
- Create shipping methods with:
  - **Shipping names** and **types** for currencies available to shoppers on the storefront.
  - Ensure that the **shipping method names and types** (e.g., `POST` for standard shipping, `EXP2` for express shipping) are supported by **ESW**.

::alert{type="info" icon="lucide:info"}
Configuring `POST`, `EXP2`, or any one of these two options for different currencies depends on the retailer’s business requirement.
::

::alert{type="secondary" icon="lucide:lightbulb"}
The shipping method names must be either `POST or EXP2`. This naming rule is required by ESW. However, the ID can be any value.
::

#### :smart-icon{name="noto-v1:world-map" size=45} Configure Shipping Method IDs by Country  

- Go to **Merchant Tools → Site Preferences → Custom Preferences → ESW Checkout Configuration**
- Configure the **shipping method IDs** for each country.
- Use the **JSON format** in the `ESW Override Shipping` custom site preference

#### :smart-icon{name="streamline-ultimate-color:mobile-shopping-cart-exchange" size=45} Step 3: Enable Override Display on Cart Page (Optional)  

- If you want to display ESW shipping **override methods** on the **cart page**, enable the preference:
  - **ESW Hide Native Shipping**  
  *(Found in `ESW Retailer Display Configuration`)*

#### :smart-icon{name="streamline-ultimate-color:delivery-truck-cargo" size=45} Step 4: Verify Shipping Methods at Checkout  

- Once configured:
  - The **standard SFCC shipping methods** mapped to each country will be displayed during the ESW Checkout process.
  - Example: The screenshot below shows shipping methods configured for **Britain (GB)**.

Ensure shipping method IDs and types match ESW’s supported configurations to display correctly at checkout.

## Additional Rules

1. Fixed Pricing Countries:
 - Shipping methods must be created with the country’s currency.
 - Example: For the UK (fixed price country), shipping methods must use GBP.

2. Dynamic Pricing Countries:
 - Shipping methods must be created with the base currency.
 - Example: For France (dynamic price, base currency USD), shipping methods must use USD.

3. Override Pricebook Configuration:

 - If ESW Override Pricebook is set under ESW Pricing Configuration for a country,
 - Shipping methods must match the currency of the override pricebook.

4. Shipping Method Count Handling:

 - If only one SFCC shipping method is configured for a country but the ESW Checkout tenant is set to display two methods → The second method from ESW shipping methods is displayed alongside the SFCC override.
 - If two SFCC shipping methods are configured but ESW Checkout is set to display only one method → The second SFCC method is ignored.

## Using ESW Shipping Methods

Retailers can choose to use ESW-managed shipping methods, eliminating the need to configure and maintain multiple shipping methods within SFCC Business Manager.

### How It Works

1. To display ESW shipping methods for a specific country:
 - Do not configure any override shipping methods in the ESW Override Shipping preference.

2. When no override is set:
 - The ESW Checkout API sends the parameter: 
 
 ```json
 "DeliveryOptions": null
```
 - This triggers the use of shipping methods from the ESW tenant configuration, which are then displayed on the ESW Checkout.
