The ESW-SFCC cartridge enables bi-directional synchronization of cancelled order statuses between Salesforce Commerce Cloud (SFCC) and ESW, ensuring consistency regardless of where the cancellation is initiated.

## Supported Flows

SFCC :smart-icon{name="lucide:arrow-right-left" size=25} ESW: Orders cancelled in SFCC are synced with ESW automatically.

ESW :smart-icon{name="lucide:arrow-right-left" size=25} SFCC: Orders cancelled via the ESW CSP are pushed and reflected in SFCC.

## eShopWorld Order Cancellation (ESW to SFCC)
When an order is cancelled on the ESW portal, the ESW-SFCC cartridge automatically:

- Retrieves the cancellation status

- Cancels the corresponding order in SFCC

- Updates all relevant order records and statuses

This ensures that SFCC remains in sync with ESW for customer service and reporting accuracy.
