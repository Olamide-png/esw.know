To enable accurate cross-border pricing and compliance, ESW requires a product catalog from retailers. This catalog is essential for calculating duties, taxes, and ensuring customs compliance for international orders.

## Purpose of the Catalog

The product catalog supports ESW in:

- Calculating correct duties and taxes per destination country

- Ensuring export control compliance

- Facilitating customs clearance through accurate data exchange

- Supporting logistics workflows with ESW fulfillment services

Typical Catalog Data Includes:

- Product Code

- Product Description

- Country of Origin

- Weight

- HS Code (Harmonized System Code)

- Other optional regulatory or customs-related attributes

Submitting this data to ESW is a critical step in enabling international sales through the ESW Checkout and logistics ecosystem. Without it, ESW cannot guarantee accurate tax/duty calculation or smooth order processing for global shoppers.

  Each time your product catalog is updated—such as when new products are added, existing products are modified, or product attributes are changed—the delta changes must be communicated to ESW.

The ESW-SFCC cartridge supports catalog synchronization through the following two methods:

1. Catalog API

Automatically used when the following conditions are met:

- The site preference **isCatalogServiceEnabled** is set to **True**.

- The Catalog Service is properly configured in SFCC.

2. Catalog Feed via SFTP

Product data is exported as a CSV feed and uploaded to ESW’s SFTP server

- Managed through the **eswRetailerCatalogFeed** job.

- Suitable for batch-based catalog synchronization.


## Catalog Feed Upload via Service

This section outlines how to upload product catalog data to ESW using the Catalog Service method.

### Prerequisites

Before using the service-based catalog upload, ensure the following configurations are in place:

1. Catalog Service Configuration

- The ESW Catalog Service must be configured in SFCC Business Manager.
- Refer to `Business Manager > Administration > ESWCatalogService`

2. Enable Catalog Service Preference

- The custom site preference **isCatalogServiceEnabled** must be set to **True**.

- Configuration path `Merchant Tools > ESW Catalog Integration Configuration`

3. Business Manager Cartridge Path

- The ESW Business Manager cartridge must be included in the cartridge path to enable the catalog UI.
- Required BM cartridge path `int_eshopworld_core:bm_eshopworld_core`

Once these prerequisites are met, the ESW Catalog Service can be used to synchronize product data in real time or via scheduled jobs, ensuring accurate and up-to-date pricing and compliance details.

## Automated Export

Catalog synchronization can be automated by scheduling the `eswRetailerCatalogFeed` job based on how frequently your catalog data changes. <br>

### Behavior of the Job:
- First-Time Execution
- When the job runs for the first time, all product data from the catalog is synchronized to ESW.

### Subsequent Executions
- On subsequent runs, the job automatically detects and syncs only the delta — newly created or updated products — since the last job execution.
- nThis automated approach ensures that your product catalog remains current with ESW without manual intervention, enabling accurate duty, tax, and compliance calculations at checkout.
- During the execution of the job, the catalog data will be exported. Once the Job is successfully executed, Navigate to `Merchant Tools > ESW > Catalog`.
- You will see a screen as below, click on the Products tabs under Catalog menu to view the product synchronization data.
