To enable accurate cross-border pricing and compliance, ESW requires a product catalog from retailers. This catalog is essential for calculating duties, taxes, and ensuring customs compliance for international orders.

## Purpose of the Catalog

The product catalog supports ESW in:

- Calculating correct duties and taxes per destination country

- Ensuring export control compliance

- Facilitating customs clearance through accurate data exchange

- Supporting logistics workflows with ESW fulfillment services

Typical Catalog Data Includes:

- Product Code

- Product Description

- Country of Origin

- Weight

- HS Code (Harmonized System Code)

- Other optional regulatory or customs-related attributes

Submitting this data to ESW is a critical step in enabling international sales through the ESW Checkout and logistics ecosystem. Without it, ESW cannot guarantee accurate tax/duty calculation or smooth order processing for global shoppers.


<br>

::alert{icon="lucide:info"}
  Each time your product catalog is updated—such as when new products are added, existing products are modified, or product attributes are changed—the delta changes must be communicated to ESW.
::

<br>

The ESW-SFCC cartridge supports catalog synchronization through the following two methods:

1. Catalog API

Automatically used when the following conditions are met:

- The site preference **isCatalogServiceEnabled** is set to **True**.

- The Catalog Service is properly configured in SFCC.

2. Catalog Feed via SFTP

Product data is exported as a CSV feed and uploaded to ESW’s SFTP server

- Managed through the **eswRetailerCatalogFeed** job.

- Suitable for batch-based catalog synchronization.


## Catalog Feed Upload via Service

This section outlines how to upload product catalog data to ESW using the Catalog Service method.

### Prerequisites

Before using the service-based catalog upload, ensure the following configurations are in place:

1. Catalog Service Configuration

- The ESW Catalog Service must be configured in SFCC Business Manager.
- Refer to `Business Manager > Administration > ESWCatalogService`

2. Enable Catalog Service Preference

- The custom site preference **isCatalogServiceEnabled** must be set to **True**.

- Configuration path `Merchant Tools > ESW Catalog Integration Configuration`

3. Business Manager Cartridge Path

- The ESW Business Manager cartridge must be included in the cartridge path to enable the catalog UI.
- Required BM cartridge path `int_eshopworld_core:bm_eshopworld_core`

Once these prerequisites are met, the ESW Catalog Service can be used to synchronize product data in real time or via scheduled jobs, ensuring accurate and up-to-date pricing and compliance details.

## Automated Export

Catalog synchronization can be automated by scheduling the `eswRetailerCatalogFeed` job based on how frequently your catalog data changes. <br>

### Behavior of the Job:
- First-Time Execution
- When the job runs for the first time, all product data from the catalog is synchronized to ESW.

### Subsequent Executions
- On subsequent runs, the job automatically detects and syncs only the delta — newly created or updated products — since the last job execution.
- nThis automated approach ensures that your product catalog remains current with ESW without manual intervention, enabling accurate duty, tax, and compliance calculations at checkout.
- During the execution of the job, the catalog data will be exported. Once the Job is successfully executed, Navigate to `Merchant Tools > ESW > Catalog`.
- You will see a screen as below, click on the Products tabs under Catalog menu to view the product synchronization data.

You will see a screen as below, click on the Products tabs under Catalog menu to view the product synchronization data.

The following table outlines the details for the Sync Status and Sync Status Message:

| :smart-icon{name="lucide:tag" size=20 class="dark:text-white"} **Field** | :smart-icon{name="lucide:file-text" size=20 class="dark:text-white"} **Description** |
|---|---|
| `Sync Status` | Indicates whether the product is synchronized with ESW. <br><br>**Values:** <br>• **Unsynced (Default):** Product is not yet synchronized to ESW Catalog.<br>• **Synced:** Product is successfully synchronized to ESW Catalog. |
| `Sync Status Message` | Provides status details and error messages (if any) during synchronization with ESW. <br><br>**Possible Messages:** <br>• **Internal Validation Errors found:** Lists missing or invalid product attributes.<br>• **Product is internally validated:** Product passed internal validation and is ready for ESW sync.<br>• **External Validation Error Found:** Error encountered during ESW Catalog API sync.<br>• **The product successfully synced to ESW:** Product successfully synchronized, along with timestamp. |

## Manual Export

## Catalog Feed Upload via SFTP

The ESW cartridge supports catalog feed delivery through SFTP in addition to the Catalog API. When configured for SFTP, the cartridge uses the eswRetailerCatalogFeed job to automate file generation and transmission.

This job performs the following actions at scheduled intervals:

- **Initial Full Catalog Upload:** On the first execution, a CSV file is generated containing all product data from the SFCC catalog and sent to the ESW catalog service.

- **Delta Catalog Upload**: On subsequent executions, the job automatically detects and syncs only the newly created or modified products since the last run.

### Configuration Notes

To enable catalog sync via SFTP:

- Ensure the Catalog Service URL is left empty: This will cause the cartridge to fall back to SFTP mode.

- Schedule or manually execute the eswRetailerCatalogFeed job via **Business Manager > Administration > Operations > Job Schedules**

> For more information about the job and its schedule, refer to **Operations > Job Schedules in the SFCC Business Manager.**

Ensure that required product attributes are populated before running the job. Incomplete product data may lead to validation errors or exclusion from the feed.

## Catalog File Transmission and Naming

The `eswRetailerCatalogFeed` job transfers catalog files to the ESW SFTP server using custom preferences and the ESW SFTP service. <br>

For configuration guidance, refer to:

- ESW Catalog Integration Configuration (for preferences)

- **Operations > Services** (for SFTP service setup)

### Catalog File Specification

For detailed information on:

- File format and structure

- Naming conventions

- Required product data fields

> Refer to the Catalog File Specification documentation.

### Supported Product Types

The Catalog Feed supports the following product types:

- Simple Product

- Variation Product

-Product part of a Set

- Product part of a Bundle

- Orderable Variation Master

### File Naming Conventions

To support multi-instance management, the ESW cartridge allows file names to be customized using a Site Preference:

- Site Preference: `ESW Catalog Feed Instance ID`

- Location: `Merchant Tools > ESW Catalog Integration Configuration`

#### Filename format:

- If the Instance ID is set: `Catalog-nnn-[SFCCInstanceID]xxxxxxxx.csv`

- If the Instance ID is not set: `Catalog-nnn-xxxxxxxx.csv`

> Use the Instance ID to easily identify catalog feeds originating from different SFCC environments.
