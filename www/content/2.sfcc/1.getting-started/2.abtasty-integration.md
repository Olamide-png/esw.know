AB Tasty is a tool used to run A/A, A/B, and other types of tests on the storefront. It offers several advantages over the default A/B testing provided by Salesforce Commerce Cloud (SFCC).

## Advantages

- **Comprehensive and Flexible**: AB Tasty offers a more robust and flexible platform for running experiments and personalization

- **Extensive Test Options**: It supports a wide variety of test types, including **multivariate**{style="color: teal"} and **multipage**{style="color: teal"} tests, enabling more complex and in-depth experimentation.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: With an intuitive interface and advanced targeting capabilities, AB Tasty makes it easy to create and manage campaigns based on user behavior, demographics, and other key criteria.

- **In-Depth Analytics**: AB Tasty provides powerful analytics and reporting tools that deliver actionable insights into user behavior, empowering retailers to make data-driven decisions and continuously optimize the site experience.

- **Centralized Reporting**: While SFCC’s native A/B testing reports are limited to the SFCC instance, AB Tasty allows plugin developers to access centralized test data across environments.

Retailers can define and manage A/B tests and personalization campaigns **directly within the AB Tasty platform**. Once configured, tests and campaigns are seamlessly applied to the **SFCC storefront**, enabling:

- Dynamic content adjustments
- User experience optimizations


## SFCC Configuration

The custom site preference `ESW AB Tasty Script Path` in the **ESW Retailer Display Configuration** is used to define the **URL path for the AB Tasty script**. The cartridge injects the below script in the header so that AB tasty script is enabled if configured.
