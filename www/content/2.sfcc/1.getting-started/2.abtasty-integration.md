AB Tasty is a tool which can be used to run A/A, A/B and other tests on the storefront. Choosing AB Tasty over Salesforce Commerce Cloud’s (SFCC) default A/B testing offers several advantages.

## Advantages

- **Comprehensive and Flexible**: AB Tasty offers a more robust and flexible platform for running experiments and delivering personalized experiences.

- **Wide Range of Test Types**: Supports various test types, including: **Multivariate tests**, **Multipage tests**. These allow for more detailed and complex experiments.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: AB Tasty’s intuitive UI and advanced targeting features allow retailers to easily customize campaigns based on: **User behavior**, **Demographics** etc.

- **Detailed Analytics and Insights**: ABTasty provides rich analytics and reporting tools that deliver deep insights into user behavior and interaction. This helps retailers make data-driven decisions to continuously optimize the site experience.

- **Centralized Reporting**: While SFCC’s native A/B testing reports are limited to the SFCC instance, AB Tasty enables **centralized reporting** that is accessible to plugin developers to obtain centralized test results.

Retailers can define and manage A/B tests and personalization campaigns **directly within the AB Tasty platform**. Once configured, tests and campaigns are seamlessly applied to the **SFCC storefront**, enabling:

- Dynamic content adjustments
- User experience optimizations


## SFCC Configuration

The custom site preference `ESW AB Tasty Script Path` in the **ESW Retailer Display Configuration** is used to define the **URL path for the AB Tasty script**. The cartridge includes the below script in the header so that AB tasty script is enabled if configured.
