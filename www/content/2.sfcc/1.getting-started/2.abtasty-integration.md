AB Tasty is a tool which can be used to run A/A, A/B and other tests on the storefront. 

## Why Choose AB Tasty Over SFCC’s Native A/B Testing?

- **Comprehensive and Flexible**  
  AB Tasty offers a more robust and flexible platform for running experiments and delivering personalized experiences.

- **Wide Range of Test Types**  
  Supports various test types, including:
  - Multivariate tests
  - Multipage tests  
  These allow for more detailed and complex experiments.

- **User-Friendly Interface**  
  AB Tasty’s intuitive UI and advanced targeting features allow retailers to easily customize campaigns based on:
  - User behavior
  - Demographics
  - Device type
  - Custom segments

- **Detailed Analytics and Insights**  
  The platform provides rich analytics and reporting tools that deliver deep insights into user behavior and interaction. This helps retailers make data-driven decisions to continuously optimize the site experience.

- **Centralized Reporting**  
  While SFCC’s native A/B testing reports are limited to the SFCC instance, AB Tasty enables **centralized reporting** that is accessible to plugin developers to obtain centralized test results.

### Campaign Management Workflow

Retailers can define and manage A/B tests and personalization campaigns **directly within the AB Tasty platform**. Once configured, tests and campaigns are seamlessly applied to the **SFCC storefront**, enabling:

- Dynamic content adjustments
- User experience optimizations


## SFCC Configuration

The custom site preference `**ESW AB Tasty Script Path**` in the **ESW Retailer Display Configuration** is used to define the **URL path for the AB Tasty script**. The cartridge includes the below script in the header so that AB tasty script is enabled if configured.

## Testing

### AB Tasty Configuration

Begin by selecting the appropriate **environment** within the AB Tasty platform (e.g., staging or production), and proceed to **create your tests**.

Below is an example configuration for an A/B test scenario:

### Example Test: Checkout Button Behavior with Restricted Products

**Test Objective:**  
Determine how users respond when restricted products are present in the cart by modifying the checkout button behavior.

#### **Test A – Default (Control Group)**{style="color: tomato"}
- **Variation:** Display the checkout button in a **disabled** state if restricted products are in the cart.

#### **Test B – Variant**{style="color:  cornflowerblue"}
- **Variation:** **Hide the checkout button entirely** when restricted products are in the cart.
