To enable accurate duty and tax calculations, ESW requires a product catalog from the retailer. This catalog provides essential product data for items intended for international sale via ESW Checkout and fulfillment through ESW logistics services.

The product catalog typically includes the following details:

- Product Code

- Product Description

- Country of Origin

- Weight

- HS Code (Harmonized System Code)

Providing this data is critical for:

- Accurate calculation of duties and taxes

- Ensuring export compliance

- Facilitating smooth customs clearance

Without this integration, ESW cannot guarantee the correct handling of cross-border orders.

  Each time the product catalog is updated, for example, if new products are added, the delta changes are required by ESW and should be updated using the methods outlined below

## Catalog Synchronization Methods

The ESW SFCC cartridge supports catalog synchronization through the following methods:

1. **Catalog API**
Direct integration using ESW’s Catalog API to send product data.

2. **Catalog Feed via SFTP**
Uploading a catalog file to ESW’s SFTP server for processing.

If the custom preference `isCatalogServiceEnabled` is set to `True` and the catalog service is properly configured, the Catalog API method will be used for synchronization automatically.

## Catalog Feed Upload via Service

This section describes the steps and prerequisites for uploading the product catalog using the ESW Catalog Service.

### Prerequisites

1. Catalog Service Configuration

Ensure that the Catalog Service is configured in SFCC Business Manager.

> For setup details, refer to **Business Manager > Administration > ESWCatalogService**

2. Enable Catalog Service

The custom preference `isCatalogServiceEnabled` must be set to `True`.

>You can configure this under **Merchant Tools > ESW Catalog Integration Configuration**

3. BM Cartridge Path Configuration

The ESW Business Manager cartridge must be included in the cartridge path to access the catalog menu. <br>

The required path `int_eshopworld_core:bm_eshopworld_core` <br>

Once the above configurations are in place, the ESW Catalog Service will be enabled for uploading and synchronizing your product catalog.

## Automated Export
Catalog export can be automated by scheduling a job based on how frequently your product catalog is updated.

### Scheduled Job: `eswRetailerCatalogFeed`

Once the job `eswRetailerCatalogFeed` is executed:

**First-Time Execution**: All product data from the catalog will be synchronized in full.

**Subsequent Executions**: Only newly created or updated products (since the last run) will be included in the export as a delta update. <br>

This approach ensures efficient catalog synchronization while minimizing redundant data transfer.

### Post-Execution Steps

During job execution, the catalog data is exported and sent to ESW. <br>

Once the job completes successfully:

::steps{:level="4"}
  #### :smart-icon{name="lucide:ship-wheel" size=25} Navigate

  Navigate to **Merchant Tools > ESW > Catalog**

  #### :smart-icon{name="lucide:mouse-pointer-click" size=25} Click

  Under the Catalog menu, click on the Products tab

  #### :smart-icon{name="lucide:binouculars" size=25} View

  You will be able to view the product synchronization data, including synced items and their status.
