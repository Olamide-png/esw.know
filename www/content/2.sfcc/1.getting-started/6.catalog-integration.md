To enable accurate duty and tax calculations, ESW requires a product catalog from the retailer. This catalog provides essential product data for items intended for international sale via ESW Checkout and fulfillment through ESW logistics services.

The product catalog typically includes the following details:

- Product Code

- Product Description

- Country of Origin

- Weight

- HS Code (Harmonized System Code)

Providing this data is critical for:

- Accurate calculation of duties and taxes

- Ensuring export compliance

- Facilitating smooth customs clearance

Without this integration, ESW cannot guarantee the correct handling of cross-border orders.

::alert{type="secondary" icon="lucide:lightbulb"}
  Each time the product catalog is updated, for example, if new products are added, the delta changes are required by ESW and should be updated using the methods outlined below
::

## Catalog Synchronization Methods

The ESW SFCC cartridge supports catalog synchronization through the following methods:

1. **Catalog API**
Direct integration using ESW’s Catalog API to send product data.

2. **Catalog Feed via SFTP**
Uploading a catalog file to ESW’s SFTP server for processing.

If the custom preference `isCatalogServiceEnabled` is set to `True` and the catalog service is properly configured, the Catalog API method will be used for synchronization automatically.

## Catalog Feed Upload via Service

This section describes the steps and prerequisites for uploading the product catalog using the ESW Catalog Service.

### Prerequisites

1. Catalog Service Configuration

Ensure that the Catalog Service is configured in SFCC Business Manager.

> For setup details, refer to **Business Manager > Administration > ESWCatalogService**

2. Enable Catalog Service

The custom preference `isCatalogServiceEnabled` must be set to `True`.

>You can configure this under **Merchant Tools > ESW Catalog Integration Configuration**

3. BM Cartridge Path Configuration

The ESW Business Manager cartridge must be included in the cartridge path to access the catalog menu. <br>

The required path `int_eshopworld_core:bm_eshopworld_core` <br>

Once the above configurations are in place, the ESW Catalog Service will be enabled for uploading and synchronizing your product catalog.

## Automated Export
Catalog export can be automated by scheduling a job based on how frequently your product catalog is updated.

### Scheduled Job: `eswRetailerCatalogFeed`

Once the job `eswRetailerCatalogFeed` is executed:

**First-Time Execution**: All product data from the catalog will be synchronized in full.

**Subsequent Executions**: Only newly created or updated products (since the last run) will be included in the export as a delta update. <br>

This approach ensures efficient catalog synchronization while minimizing redundant data transfer.

### Post-Execution Steps

During job execution, the catalog data is exported and sent to ESW. <br>

Once the job completes successfully:

## Manual Export
In addition to scheduled jobs, you can also manually synchronize your product catalog using the SFCC Business Manager interface. <br>

Steps to Perform Manual Sync

::steps{:level="4"}
  #### :smart-icon{name="lucide:ship-wheel" size=25} Navigate to Merchant Tools 

  Navigate to **Merchant Tools > ESW > Catalog in SFCC Business Manager**.

  #### :smart-icon{name="lucide:mouse-pointer-folder-sync" size=25} Sync

  Under the Catalog menu, click on the Products tab

  #### :smart-icon{name="lucide:binouculars" size=25} View

  On the Catalog page, you will see a list of catalog products available for synchronization. <br>

  perform the following actions:

  - **Sync All**: Synchronize all eligible products in the catalog.
  - **Sync Selected**: Select specific products and click Sync Selected to synchronize only those items.

  Sync Status and Sync Status Message will be updated. The error details of the internal validation can be viewed by hovering on the error status message as shown in the following image:

### Status & Validation
- The Sync Status and Sync Status Message fields reflect the result of the synchronization.
- If any internal validation errors occur, hover over the error status message to view detailed error information.

### Catalog Configuration via Business Manager
Catalog settings can be managed through the ESW Catalog module in SFCC Business Manager.

- Click Catalog Configuration to access the configuration panel.

The Catalog Configuration page dynamically displays configuration options based on the presence of a Service URL in the Catalog Service setup:

- If the Service URL is configured, the page will display API-based configurations.

::card

::steps{:level="4"}
  #### :smart-icon{name="lucide:code-xml" size=25} Configure the API 

  Navigate to **Merchant Tools > ESW > Catalog in SFCC Business Manager**.

  Set up the Catalog Service API in SFCC Business Manager.

  ::

  #### :smart-icon{name="lucide:binoculars" size=25} Verify Product Attributes

  Ensure all products have the **minimum required parameters**.

  You can edit products by navigating to **Merchant Tools > Products & Catalogs > Products**

  ::card
  ---
  img: /image-20230912-085606.png
  ---
  ::

  #### :smart-icon{name="lucide:footprints" size=25} Run the Job

  Execute the scheduled job e.g., `eswRetailerCatalogFeed`.

  #### :smart-icon{name="lucide:folder-sync" size=25} Validate Sync Status

  Check the Sync Status to confirm that the products have been successfully synchronized.

  ::card
  ---
  img: /image-20230912-085631.png
  ---
  ::

  #### :smart-icon{name="lucide:biceps-flexed" size=25} Manual Testing (Optional)

  - Select specific products in the ESW Catalog UI.
  - Click Sync Selected.
  - Verify the status and messages as described in the steps above.  

  ::card
  ---
  img: /image-20230912-085652.png

These steps ensure that your catalog data is correctly validated and synchronized with ESW during sandbox testing.

## Catalog Feed Upload via SFTP
The ESW SFCC cartridge also supports catalog synchronization via SFTP. This method is useful when API integration is not configured.

#### Automated Sync via Scheduled Job

The job `eswRetailerCatalogFeed`, included in the cartridge, is scheduled to run at predefined intervals and performs the following actions:

- Initial Full Catalog Upload: Automatically uploads the complete product catalog to the ESW Catalog Service during the first run.

- Delta Catalog Upload: Continuously monitors the catalog in SFCC and synchronizes delta updates (newly added or modified products) in subsequent runs.

This approach ensures that your catalog remains up to date without requiring manual intervention.

## Initial Full Catalog Upload

When the `eswRetailerCatalogFeed` job is executed for the first time, it performs a full export of the product catalog.

- A CSV file is generated containing details of all products in the catalog.

- This file is then uploaded to the ESW Catalog Service via SFTP.

- The exported data includes key attributes required for duty, tax, and compliance processing.

This initial upload establishes the baseline product catalog for ESW to use in cross-border calculations and logistics handling.

## Delta Catalog Upload
After the initial full catalog upload, subsequent executions of the `eswRetailerCatalogFeed` job perform a delta update.

- The job identifies any new products or existing products that have been updated since the last execution.
- Only these delta changes are compiled and included in the export.
- The resulting file is then transmitted to the ESW Catalog Service via SFTP.

This incremental update process ensures the catalog remains current without re-uploading the entire product set.

## File Transfer and Configuration
The `eswRetailerCatalogFeed` job uses custom preferences and the configured ESW SFTP service to transfer catalog files to the SFTP server.

For setup details, refer to:

- Custom Preferences: Merchant Tools > ESW Catalog Integration Configuration

- SFTP Service Configuration: Administration > Operations > Services

## Supported Product Types

The catalog feed supports the following product types:

- Simple Product

- Variation Product

- Product in a Set

- Product in a Bundle

- Orderable Variation Master

## Instance ID in File Naming

To distinguish catalog feeds by SFCC instance, the cartridge allows storing an Instance ID via the site preference: <br>

ESW Catalog Feed Instance ID (found under ESW Catalog Integration Configuration).

- If the Instance ID is defined, the file name is generated as `Catalog-nnn-[SFCCInstanceID]xxxxxxxx`

- If the Instance ID is not set, the file name defaults to `Catalog-nnn-xxxxxxxx`

This mechanism helps uniquely identify feed files per SFCC instance during multi-instance or multi-site catalog operations.
