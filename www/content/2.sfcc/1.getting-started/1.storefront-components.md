### Welcome Mat

The welcome mat is a modal window that appears when shoppers visit your online store for the first time. It allows them to select their shipping country, preferred language, and currency. To apply these changes, shoppers click <kbd class="px-3 py-2 text-sm font-semibold text-gray-900 bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg shadow-outer">Continue Shopping</kbd>. They can also update these preferences at any time later from the header or footer.
