## Fulfillment Models

ESW offers multiple fulfillment models—such as Hub and Ship from Store (Hubless)—to support various retailer logistics strategies. Each model follows a distinct order processing flow.

## Hub Model

The ESW-SFCC cartridge supports the Hub model, enabling retailers to synchronize shipment/package data with the ESW Package Service.

### Overview
In the Hub model:

- Retailers ship goods to an ESW distribution hub.

- ESW then handles the final-mile delivery to the shopper.

To operate under this model, retailers are required to send an Advance Shipping Notification (ASN) for each package to ESW before the physical packages arrive at the hub.

> The ASN enables ESW to prepare for receipt, processing, and onward dispatch of shipments, ensuring efficient fulfillment operations.

## Sending an Advance Shipping Notification (ASN) to ESW
Retailers can send an Advance Shipping Notification (ASN) to ESW using the **eswRetailerPackageFeed** job within SFCC.

### How It Works
- The job synchronizes package data by invoking the EswPackageV4Service (ESW Package Service).

- It includes all packages shipped from the retailer's hub that contain real-time shipment details such as:
 - Tracking number
 - Package reference

These packages are bundled into the ASN and transmitted to ESW in advance of physical shipment arrival.

### Response Handling
When the ASN is successfully received:
- ESW returns a unique ESW Package Reference for each package.
- The SFCC job stores this reference at the order level as the ESW Tracking Number.
- The order is also updated with ESW Received ASN? = True, confirming receipt by ESW.

This process ensures that ESW is prepared to receive, track, and process incoming packages from the retailer hub.

### Syncing an ASN from ESW
The ESW SFCC cartridge supports the ability to synchronize packages initiated on the ESW portal back into the SFCC environment.

Use Case
When an order or line item is marked as shipped on the ESW portal, the corresponding shipment data is sent back to SFCC. This information is stored in custom order attributes and can be leveraged for:

- Internal reporting
- Order status updates
- Synchronization with downstream systems (e.g., ERP or OMS)

### How It Works

- The `eswRetailerPackageFeed` job contains a dedicated step named `getASNFromESW`.
- This step retrieves the ASN payload from ESW and updates the relevant order records in SFCC.

Once executed, the package information from ESW is mapped to the order in SFCC, ensuring both systems are aligned.

This process ensures full bidirectional synchronization for package and shipment data between the ESW platform and your SFCC instance.

## Viewing ESW Tracking Number
Once the ESW Package Reference is returned by ESW and stored in SFCC as a custom order attribute (labelled ESW Tracking Number), it becomes accessible to registered shoppers.

### How Shoppers Can Track Their Order

1. Registered users can log in to their account.

2. Navigate to the Order History section.

3. The ESW Tracking Number is displayed along with the order details.

## ESW Tracking Portal

When a shopper clicks on the ESW Tracking Number in their order history, they are redirected to the retailer-specific ESW Tracking Portal.

### What Shoppers Can See

On the ESW Tracking Portal, shoppers can view detailed shipment information, including:

- Current shipment status

- Estimated delivery date

- Courier details and tracking events

- Delivery milestones and location updates

## Testing Synchronization of ASN from ESW to SFCC

To test the synchronization of Advance Shipping Notifications (ASNs) from ESW to SFCC, follow the steps below:

::steps{:level="4"}
  #### :smart-icon{name="lucide:cable" size=25} Enable the Feature
  
  - Navigate to **Business Manager > Merchant Tools > Custom Preferences > ESW General Configuration**
  - Enable the setting for syncing ASNs from ESW to SFCC

  #### :smart-icon{name="lucide:folder-cog" size=25}  Verify Job Configuration
  
  Ensure that the `eswRetailerPackageFeed` job includes a step named `custom.ESW_GetASN` <br>
  This step is responsible for fetching package details from ESW and syncing them with SFCC.
