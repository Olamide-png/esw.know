The ESW Stored Payment Cards feature allows logged-in shoppers to securely save and reuse their payment cards for a faster, more convenient checkout experience. Key benefits include:

- **Accelerated Checkout**: Stored cards streamline the payment process, reducing friction and saving time at checkout.

- **Increased Conversions**: A faster checkout flow is proven to boost shopper conversion rates, directly contributing to higher retailer revenue.

- **Enhanced User Experience**: Repeat shoppers enjoy a smoother experience, increasing satisfaction and fostering brand loyalty.

- **Effortless Integration**: Delivered as a standard, plug-and-play SFCC plugin with minimal setup or development effort required.
