The ESW Marketing Opt-In feature enables retailers to manage marketing communication preferences for shoppers in compliance with consent-based marketing practices.

## Key Benefits

- **Custom Marketing Channels**: Allows retailers to create targeted newsletters, notification emails, and SMS campaigns specifically for shoppers who have opted in to receive marketing communications.
- **Checkout Integration**: The opt-in preference for registered shoppers can be passed to the pre-order payload, automatically enabling the opt-in checkbox during ESW Checkout for users who have previously consented.- **Shopper Control**: Shoppers can easily opt out of marketing communications by unchecking the **opt-in** checkbox at checkout.
- **Marketing Cloud Sync**: Opt-in preferences can also be synced with external marketing cloud platforms such as Salesforce Marketing Cloud (SFMC), Bronto, and others to maintain up-to-date subscriber lists.

## How Does This Work?

The shopper journey is divided into two main steps:

::steps{:level="5"}
  ##### :smart-icon{name="lucide:shopping-cart" size=20} Shopper Initiates Checkout

   A shopper adds an item to the cart and proceeds to checkout.

  - If the user is logged in and has already opted in (via a custom profile preference):
   - Add meta in the pre-order request to enable the email opt-in checkbox on the ESW Checkout page.

  - If the user is a guest or has not opted in (unchecked preference):
   - Add meta in the pre-order request to disable the email opt-in checkbox on the ESW Checkout page.

  ##### :smart-icon{name="lucide:lasso-select" size=20} Assign the customer group to a campaign.
  
  After successful payment, ESW places the order and invokes SFCC to update the order configuration.

  - If the shopper checked the opt-in checkbox on ESW Checkout:
   - SFCC fetches the shopper profile (if it exists) and updates the `eswMarketingOptIn` preference to `true`.
  
  - If the shopper did not check the opt-in checkbox:
   - SFCC updates the shopper profile preference accordingly to reflect the opt-out status.

## ESW SMS Marketing Opt-In

The ESW SMS Marketing Opt-In feature allows retailers to capture shopper consent for SMS marketing during the checkout process and sync that preference with the shopper's profile in SFCC. <br>

This flow is divided into two key stages:

1. **Shopper Proceeds to Checkout**
When the shopper adds an item to the cart and clicks Checkout, the following logic applies:

- If the shopper is logged in and has previously opted in for SMS marketing:
 - The system includes the `eswSMSOptin` meta field in the pre-order request with a value of `true`.
 - This ensures that the SMS opt-in box is pre-checked on the ESW Checkout page.

- If the shopper is a guest, first-time shopper, or has not opted in:
 - The `eswSMSOptin` meta field is included with a value of `false`.
 - The SMS opt-in checkbox on the ESW Checkout page will be unchecked.

2. **Order Completion and Profile Update**

Once the order is placed successfully:

- **ESW calls back SFCC** via the order confirmation webhook to update shopper profile data.

#### If the shopper checked the SMS opt-in box during ESW checkout:
- SFCC updates the shopper’s profile preference `eswSMSOptin` to `true`.

#### If a registered customer unchecked the SMS opt-in:
- The profile preference is updated to `false`.

#### For guest shoppers:
- If a profile exists in SFCC matching the order email **and** the SMS opt-in was checked, the system updates `eswSMSOptin` to `true`.
- If SMS opt-in was **not** checked, the profile remains unchanged.

#### For shoppers who register after placing the order:
- If the post-registration feature is used, their newly created profile will reflect the SMS opt-in value selected during checkout.
 

## ESW Opt-In Configuration in the Customer Profile

Customer profiles can be used to manage **ESW opt-in preferences**, allowing merchants to create and deliver targeted newsletters and SMS campaigns to shoppers who have explicitly opted in.

To access and manage customer profiles, navigate to:  
**Merchant Tools → Customers → Customer Profile**


### ESW Opt-In Preferences

Each customer profile includes the following opt-in attributes:

- **ESW Marketing Opt-In**  
  Indicates whether the customer has opted in to receive **ESW marketing emails**.

- **ESW SMS Marketing Opt-In**  
  Indicates whether the customer has opted in to receive **ESW SMS marketing messages**.

### Usage

- Filter and segment their customer list
