The ESW cartridge supports the use of promotional price books for specific customers by leveraging customer groups. This integration provides flexibility to show targeted pricing by combining ESW’s pricing capabilities with SFCC’s native promotion engine. <br>

With this feature, you can deliver special pricing to defined customer segments based on country, currency, or pricing model using custom session variables provided by the ESW cartridge.
