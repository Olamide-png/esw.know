The ESW Marketing Opt-in feature enables retailers to manage shopper communication preferences more effectively. Below are the key benefits and capabilities:

- **Targeted Communications:** Create separate newsletters, notification emails, and SMS campaigns specifically for shoppers who have opted in.

- **Seamless Opt-In Handling:** The opt-in preference of registered shoppers can be passed in the pre-order payload, automatically enabling the opt-in checkbox at ESW checkout for those who previously subscribed.

- **Flexible Opt-Out Option:** Shoppers retain control and can opt out anytime by unchecking the opt-in box during checkout.

- **Integration with Marketing Platforms:** Opt-in data can be stored and synced with external marketing platforms such as Salesforce Marketing Cloud (SFMC), Bronto, and others, enabling centralized campaign management.
