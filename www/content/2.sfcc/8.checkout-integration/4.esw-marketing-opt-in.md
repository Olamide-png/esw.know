The ESW Marketing Opt-in feature enables retailers to manage shopper communication preferences more effectively. Below are the key benefits and capabilities:

- **Targeted Communications:** Create separate newsletters, notification emails, and SMS campaigns specifically for shoppers who have opted in.

- **Seamless Opt-In Handling:** The opt-in preference of registered shoppers can be passed in the pre-order payload, automatically enabling the opt-in checkbox at ESW checkout for those who previously subscribed.

- **Flexible Opt-Out Option:** Shoppers retain control and can opt out anytime by unchecking the opt-in box during checkout.

- **Integration with Marketing Platforms:** Opt-in data can be stored and synced with external marketing platforms such as Salesforce Marketing Cloud (SFMC), Bronto, and others, enabling centralized campaign management.

  After a successful payment, ESW places the order and calls SFCC to update the order record. <br>

  - **Opted In at Checkout**:  
    ESW retrieves the SFCC profile (if it exists) and sets  
    `custom.eswMarketingOptIn = true`.

    <br>

  - **Opted Out at Checkout**:  
    SFCC profile is updated to  
    `custom.eswMarketingOptIn = false`.

## ESW Opt-In Configuration in the Customer Profile

Customer profiles in SFCC can be used to manage ESW marketing opt-in preferences, enabling merchants to target subscribed shoppers with personalized campaigns such as newsletters, emails, and SMS.

### Accessing Customer Profiles

**To view and manage opt-in preferences:** Navigate to `Merchant Tools > Customers > Customer Profile`

### ESW Opt-In Preferences

Each customer profile includes the following custom attributes:

- **ESW Marketing Opt-In:** Indicates whether the customer has opted in to ESW marketing emails.

- **ESW SMS Marketing Opt-In:** Indicates whether the customer has opted in to ESW SMS marketing.

## Shopper Experience

This section describes how the ESW Marketing Opt-In and SMS Opt-In features impact the shopper journey during checkout.

### First-Time Shopper Experience

For new or guest shoppers who have not previously set their Marketing Opt-In or SMS Marketing Opt-In preferences:

- When they proceed to the ESW checkout, both opt-in checkboxes (Email and SMS) will be unchecked by default.

- Shoppers have the option to manually opt in by checking either or both boxes during checkout.

- Their selections will be captured and stored:

  - For guest shoppers, the preferences will be applied to their profile if they register later.

  - For returning shoppers, the preferences will be updated in their existing SFCC customer profile.
