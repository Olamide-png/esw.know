The ESW Marketing Opt-in feature enables retailers to manage shopper communication preferences more effectively. Below are the key benefits and capabilities:

- **Targeted Communications:** Create separate newsletters, notification emails, and SMS campaigns specifically for shoppers who have opted in.

- **Seamless Opt-In Handling:** The opt-in preference of registered shoppers can be passed in the pre-order payload, automatically enabling the opt-in checkbox at ESW checkout for those who previously subscribed.

- **Flexible Opt-Out Option:** Shoppers retain control and can opt out anytime by unchecking the opt-in box during checkout.

- **Integration with Marketing Platforms:** Opt-in data can be stored and synced with external marketing platforms such as Salesforce Marketing Cloud (SFMC), Bronto, and others, enabling centralized campaign management.

  The shopper adds items to the cart and clicks **Checkout**.
  
  - **Logged-in + Opt-In Enabled**:  
    Metadata is included in the pre-order request to **enable** email marketing opt-in on ESW checkout.
  
  - **Guest or Opt-In Disabled**:  
    Metadata is included to **disable** email marketing opt-in.

  After a successful payment, ESW places the order and calls SFCC to update the order record.

  - **Opted In at Checkout**:  
    ESW retrieves the SFCC profile (if it exists) and sets  
    `custom.eswMarketingOptIn = true`.

  - **Opted Out at Checkout**:  
    SFCC profile is updated to  
    `custom.eswMarketingOptIn = false`.
