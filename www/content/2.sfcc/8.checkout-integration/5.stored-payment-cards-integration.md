The ESW Stored Payment Cards feature allows logged-in shoppers to securely save their payment card details, enabling a faster and smoother checkout experience on future purchases.

## Key Benefits

- **Accelerated Checkout Experience:** Shoppers can complete purchases quickly using previously saved cards, reducing friction at checkout.

- **Increased Conversion Rates:** Faster checkout is a proven method to boost shopper conversion, leading to higher revenue for retailers.

- **Enhanced Shopper Satisfaction:** Repeat shoppers benefit from a convenient experience, which builds brand loyalty and encourages repeat purchases.

- **Effortless Integration:**  This is a plug-and-play feature built on the standard SFCC plugin, requiring minimal integration effort from the retailer.

Stored Payment Cards Integration

Workflow between the ESW-SFCC plugin/cartridge, ESW Checkout, and ESW Payments
::


## Workflow Assumptions

The Stored Payment Cards feature operates under the following conditions:

- The shopper is already logged in to their account.

- The checkout process is executed in a secure (HTTPS) context.

- Both the retailer’s site and the ESW checkout are hosted under the same top-level domain (TLD) to ensure secure and seamless card storage and retrieval.


### Stored Payment Cards – Shopper Workflow

::steps{:level="4"}

#### :smart-icon{name="streamline-ultimate-color:shopping-cart-full" size=55} Shopper Adds Item to Cart  

- The shopper adds a product to the cart and clicks the **Checkout** button.


#### :smart-icon{name="streamline-ultimate-color:sd-card-sync" size=55} Authentication Check  

- If the shopper is not already logged in, they are presented with:
  - **Forced Login**, or
  - **Guest Checkout** (if enabled)

**Note:** Stored card functionality is only available to **logged-in shoppers**.

#### :smart-icon{name="streamline-ultimate-color:e-commerce-apparel" size=55} Order Creation in SFCC  

- After login, the **ESW SFCC Plugin** creates a new order in SFCC.  
- The order status is set to `Created`.


#### :smart-icon{name="streamline-ultimate-color:e-commerce-touch-buy" size=55} Pre-Order Request Assembly  

- The plugin extracts the `registeredProfileId` and builds the **pre-order payload**.  
- This payload is submitted to the **ESW Checkout API** to initiate the ESW checkout experience.


#### :smart-icon{name="streamline-ultimate-color:app-window-code" size=55} ESW Checkout API Response  

- On success, the response returns:
  - A **Checkout URL** for shopper redirection.
  - A **shopper access token** (`shopperAccessToken`) to be stored as a browser cookie using the key:  
    **`esw-shopper-access-token`**


#### :smart-icon{name="streamline-ultimate-color:file-code-check" size=55} Handling the Access Token in SFCC  

- The plugin checks for the access token:
  - If present, it sets a **browser cookie** using the domain from the **ESW Top-Level Domain** preference.
  - If absent, the shopper is still redirected to the ESW Checkout URL.


#### :smart-icon{name="streamline-ultimate-color:wireless-payment-credit-card-dollar" size=55} ESW Checkout – Payment Panel Logic  

- On reaching the **Payment Panel**, the ESW Checkout:
  - Reads the `esw-shopper-access-token` from the cookie.
  - Validates the token.
  - Makes a **server-to-server call** to the ESW Payment API to fetch stored cards.


#### :smart-icon{name="streamline-ultimate-color:credit-card-1" size=55} Stored Card Selection  

- If valid stored cards are returned:
  - The shopper sees a **dropdown menu** listing their saved payment methods.
  - The shopper can select a card and proceed to **complete the checkout**.
