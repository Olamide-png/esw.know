## Enabling a New Country or Market

The ESW-SFCC cartridge allows you to manage supported shipping countries directly from within the cartridge. This includes the ability to:

- Add new shipping countries

- Configure default shopper currencies for those countries

- Display the newly added countries in the storefront country selector

## Country-Currency Association

When a new country is added, you can configure its associated shopper currency.

## Enable a New Country at the Storefront

Follow the steps below:

::steps{:level="4"}
  #### :smart-icon{name="lucide:repeat-1" size=30} Run the Retailer Pricing Feed Job

  Execute the Retailer Pricing Feed job from SFCC Business Manager. This job retrieves the FX rates and country-level adjustments for the newly added country and stores them in SFCC custom objects.


  #### :smart-icon{name="lucide:airplay" size=30} Run the ESW Retailer Auto Configurator Job

  Execute the ESW Retailer Auto Configurator job to automatically generate:
  - Custom object instances for the new country (ESW Countries)
  - Custom object instances for its associated currency (ESW Currencies)

  > These will only be created if they do not already exist.

  #### :smart-icon{name="lucide:coins" size=30} (Optional) Configure Base Currency and Pricing Model

  If the base currency for the new country differs from the site’s default, configure it manually in the country’s custom object.
  - By default, the pricing model is set to dynamic (calculated).
  - To switch to fixed pricing, toggle the `isFixedPriceModel` flag in the custom object for the country.

  > For more details, refer to the [ESW Pricing Integration] documentation.

  #### :smart-icon{name="lucide:binoculars" size=30} (Optional) Verify the country and currency information

  Verify the country and currency information on the storefront and other webpages. The newly added country will also be available on welcome mat.

::alert{title="Info" icon="lucide:lamb" size=30}
  New ESW supported country needs to be configured on the ESW tenant side. This means ESW integration will configure the supported countries in the ESW Database for the tenant. <br>
  Any non-supported country will have to be added manually from the retailer’s end.

## Verify the New Country-Currency Selection

Once the new country has been enabled and its country-currency mapping is configured:

Open the SFCC storefront.

Use the country selector dropdown to choose the newly added country.

Confirm that the default currency mapped to that country is automatically selected and displayed throughout the storefront (e.g., product listings, cart, checkout).

This verification step ensures that the shopper experience reflects the correct regional settings for the newly configured market.
