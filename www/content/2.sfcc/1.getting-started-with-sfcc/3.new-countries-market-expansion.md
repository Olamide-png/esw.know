## Enabling a New Country or Market

The ESW-SFCC cartridge allows you to manage supported shipping countries directly from within the cartridge. This includes the ability to:

- Add new shipping countries

- Configure default shopper currencies for those countries

- Display the newly added countries in the storefront country selector

## Country-Currency Association

When a new country is added, you can configure its associated shopper currency.

  When a shopper selects this country from the country selector, the corresponding currency is displayed automatically.

## Enable a New Country at the Storefront

Follow the steps below:

::steps{:level="4"}
  #### :smart-icon{name="streamline-ultimate-color:startup-launch" size=30} Run the Retailer Pricing Feed Job

  Execute the Retailer Pricing Feed job from SFCC Business Manager. This job retrieves the FX rates and country-level adjustments for the newly added country and stores them in SFCC custom objects.


  #### :smart-icon{name="streamline-ultimate-color:e-commerce-shopping-bag" size=30} Run the ESW Retailer Auto Configurator Job

  Execute the ESW Retailer Auto Configurator job to automatically generate:
  - Custom object instances for the new country (ESW Countries)
  - Custom object instances for its associated currency (ESW Currencies)

  > These will only be created if they do not already exist.

  #### :smart-icon{name="streamline-ultimate-color:accounting-coins" size=30} (Optional) Configure Base Currency and Pricing Model

  If the base currency for the new country differs from the site’s default, configure it manually in the country’s custom object.
  - By default, the pricing model is set to dynamic (calculated).
  - To switch to fixed pricing, toggle the `isFixedPriceModel` flag in the custom object for the country.

  > For more details, refer to the [ESW Pricing Integration] documentation.

  #### :smart-icon{name="streamline-stickies-color:online-information" size=30} (Optional) Verify the country and currency information

  Verify the country and currency information on the storefront and other webpages. The newly added country will also be available on welcome mat.
::

::alert{title="Info" icon="lucide:lamp" size=30}
  New ESW supported country needs to be configured on the ESW tenant side. This means ESW integration will configure the supported countries in the ESW Database for the tenant. Any non-supported country will have to be added manually from the retailer’s end.
::


## Verify the New Country-Currency Selection

Once the new country has been enabled and its country-currency mapping is configured:

## Final Configuration Checks

After enabling a new country, ensure the following configurations are aligned with your pricing model and business requirements:

- Override Pricebook settings (if using fixed pricing)

- Override Shipping Method (specific to the new country, if applicable)

- ESW FX Rates (fetched and stored via the Pricing Feed job)

- BM Currencies and their formatting

- Any other country-specific rules or overrides

> For detailed setup instructions, refer to the [ESW Pricing Configuration] documentation.

## ESW Checkout Tenant Configuration

Additionally, ensure that the new country is configured on the ESW Checkout tenant:

- This enables correct routing and shopper redirection during checkout.

- If the country is not set up on the ESW side, redirection from SFCC may fail or show an error.

Verifying both SFCC and ESW tenant configurations ensures a seamless shopper experience across pricing, currency, and checkout flows.
