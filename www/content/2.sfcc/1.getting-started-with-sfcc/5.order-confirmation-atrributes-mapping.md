## Data Transformations for OMS / Downstream Processing

The ESW-SFCC cartridge provides a set of custom attributes and enriched data specifically designed to support:
- Financial reconciliation
- Order reporting
- Integration with Order Management Systems (OMS) and other downstream platforms

### Standard Usage

In most cases, retailers can export these custom attributes as-is along with standard order data to their OMS. No additional transformation is typically required.

### When Data Transformation is Needed
However, there may be scenarios where custom logic or formatting adjustments are required before integration, such as:

- Mapping ESW fields to OMS-specific schemas

- Converting currency formats, price breakdowns, or rounding models

- Aggregating or splitting line item-level attributes (e.g., duties, taxes, FX-adjusted prices)

- Filtering ESW-specific fields that are not required by downstream systems

### Best Practice

Retailers should evaluate:

- The structure of their OMS or ERP systems

- The specific fields used for financial or operational processing

- Whether data normalization or enrichment is needed prior to export

This ensures a clean and accurate transfer of ESW-enhanced order data into existing retail backend systems.

### Example: Calculating Pre-Discount Order Subtotal (Excluding Duty & Taxes)

One of the key ESW custom attributes, `eswShopperCurrencyTotal`, holds the order subtotal after discounts, excluding duties and taxes. <br>

To calculate the pre-discount subtotal (also excluding duties and taxes), you can apply the following logic:

#### Formula

Iterate over each product line item in the order and apply:

```shell
Pre-discount subtotal = 
(Shopper Currency Price Before Discount × Quantity) – (Duty + Tax)
```

Where:

- Shopper Currency Price Before Discount = `eswUnitPrice`

- Duty = `eswDutyAmount`

- Tax = `eswTaxAmount`
