## Overview

The **ESW-SFCC cartridge**{style="color: tomato"} enables merchants to control how prices are displayed across the storefront, shopping cart, and ESW Checkout by configuring the **ESW Rounding Rules**. <br>

These rules apply only to countries and currencies that use the **Calculated Pricing Model**.

## Implement Rounding Rules

Rounding behavior is configured within Salesforce B2C Commerce Business Manager. To define or modify rounding rules: <br>

Navigate to <code class="px-1 py-0.5 rounded bg-gray-100 dark:bg-neutral-800 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 text-xs font-JetBrains Mono">Merchant Tools → Custom Objects → Custom Object Editor → ESW_PA_DATA → ESW Rounding Rules </code>

Once configured, these rules will be applied automatically to all prices calculated via the ESW Pricing Advisor, ensuring consistent price presentation across the shopper journey.

### How Rounding Rules Are Applied

The ESW Rounding Rules are automatically applied to the appropriate country and currency after the `retailerPricingFeed` job is executed. <br>

Below is a sample payload structure illustrating how rounding rules are assigned per country and currency:

```json [Sample Payload] height=150 collapse
{
  "deliveryCountryIso": "GB",
  "roundingModels": [
    {
      "currencyIso": "GBP",
      "currencyExponent": 2,
      "direction": "Up",
      "model": "none.fixed99"
    }
  ]
},
{
  "deliveryCountryIso": "JP",
  "roundingModels": [
    {
      "currencyIso": "JPY",
      "currencyExponent": 0,
      "direction": "Nearest",
      "model": "multiple1000.none"
    }
  ]
}
```
<br>

::field-group
  ::field{name="deliveryCountryIso" type="string" required}
  ISO code of the shopper’s delivery country.
  ::

  ::field{name="currencyIso" type="string" required}
  Currency to which the rounding rule applies.  (e.g., `GBP`, `JPY`).
  ::

  ::field{name="currencyExponent" type="integer" required}
  Number of decimal places used (e.g., `2` for GBP).
  ::

  ::field{name="direction" type="enum" values="Up, Down, Nearest" required}
  Rounding direction (`Up`, `Down`, `Nearest`).
  ::

  ::field{name="model" type="string" required}
  Indicates the rounding model that will be applied to product price within ESW Rounding Methods (e.g., `Fixed`, `Multiple`, and `None`).<br>
  For the `multiple1000.none` or `none.fixed99` rounding models, the rounding methods are `Fixed`, `Multiple` and `None`
  ::

<br>

**Multiple Currency Rounding Rules per Country**

```json [Sample Payload] height=150 collapse
{
  "deliveryCountryIso": "FR",
  "roundingModels": [
    {
      "currencyIso": "EUR",
      "currencyExponent": 2,
      "direction": "Up",
      "model": "none.none"
    },
    {
      "currencyIso": "GBP",
      "currencyExponent": 2,
      "direction": "Down",
      "model": "none.fixed99"
    }
  ]
}
```
<br>

## Model Rules

The following model rules govern how price values are adjusted based on the relationship between the currency exponent and the number of digits defined in the rounding model:

**Truncate**

If the number of digits in the rounding model exceeds the number of digits allowed by the currency exponent, the extra digits are truncated. <br>

**Extend**

If the currency exponent allows more digits than the rounding model specifies, the model is extended with trailing zeros.
