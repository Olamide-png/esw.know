## Overview

The **ESW-SFCC cartridge** enables merchants to control how prices are displayed across the storefront, shopping cart, and ESW Checkout by configuring the **ESW Rounding Rules**. <br>

These rules apply only to countries and currencies that use the **Calculated Pricing Model**.

## Implement Rounding Rules

Rounding behavior is configured within Salesforce B2C Commerce Business Manager. To define or modify rounding rules: <br>

Navigate to <code class="px-1 py-0.5 rounded bg-gray-100 dark:bg-neutral-800 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 text-xs font-JetBrains Mono">Merchant Tools → Custom Objects → Custom Object Editor → ESW_PA_DATA → ESW Rounding Rules </code>

Once configured, these rules will be applied automatically to all prices calculated via the ESW Pricing Advisor, ensuring consistent price presentation across the shopper journey.
