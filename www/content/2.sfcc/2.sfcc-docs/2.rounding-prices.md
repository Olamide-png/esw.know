## Overview

The **ESW-SFCC cartridge**{style="color: tomato"} enables merchants to control how prices are displayed across the storefront, shopping cart, and ESW Checkout by configuring the **ESW Rounding Rules**. <br>

These rules apply only to countries and currencies that use the **Calculated Pricing Model**.

## Implement Rounding Rules

Rounding behavior is configured within Salesforce B2C Commerce Business Manager. To define or modify rounding rules: <br>

Navigate to <code class="px-1 py-0.5 rounded bg-gray-100 dark:bg-neutral-800 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 text-xs font-JetBrains Mono">Merchant Tools → Custom Objects → Custom Object Editor → ESW_PA_DATA → ESW Rounding Rules </code>

Once configured, these rules will be applied automatically to all prices calculated via the ESW Pricing Advisor, ensuring consistent price presentation across the shopper journey.

### How Rounding Rules Are Applied

The ESW Rounding Rules are automatically applied to the appropriate country and currency after the `retailerPricingFeed` job is executed. <br>

Below is a sample payload structure illustrating how rounding rules are assigned per country and currency:

```json height=150 collapse
{
  "deliveryCountryIso": "GB",
  "roundingModels": [
    {
      "currencyIso": "GBP",
      "currencyExponent": 2,
      "direction": "Up",
      "model": "none.fixed99"
    }
  ]
},
{
  "deliveryCountryIso": "JP",
  "roundingModels": [
    {
      "currencyIso": "JPY",
      "currencyExponent": 0,
      "direction": "Nearest",
      "model": "multiple1000.none"
    }
  ]
}
```
