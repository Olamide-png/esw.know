The Multiple FX Rates Pricing feature provides country-level control over pricing conversions, allowing you to define multiple base and settlement currencies across different regions. <br>

Instead of relying on a global default base currency (e.g., USD), this feature enables the cartridge to apply country-specific base currencies and convert prices using the corresponding FX rate.

  if you want to convert prices for Germany using GBP as the base currency instead of USD, you can set `GBP` as the `baseCurrency` for Germany in the ESW Countries custom object.
