The Localized Price Books feature allows you to generate country-specific price books by applying **FX rates, retailer uplifts, estimated duties, taxes**, and **rounding rules** provided by the **ESW Pricing Advisor**. <br>

Once generated, the final localized product prices are compiled into price books that can be **exported to external marketplaces**, enabling more targeted promotions, flexible shipping options, and improved conversion rates for international shoppers.

## `eswRetailerLocalizedPricing`

The `eswRetailerLocalizedPricing` job is responsible for converting product prices into localized values and exporting them. It works in conjunction with the ESW Localized Pricing Countries custom preference to perform the following tasks:

::steps
  ### Assign Converted Prices to Local Price Books
  
  - **If a local price book already exists**:
    - The job converts all prices from the base price book to local prices using the relevant FX rate, country-specific uplifts, and rounding rules.
    - The updated prices are assigned to the existing local price book.
  - **If a local price book does not exist**:
    - The job performs the same price conversion process and assigns the resulting prices to a **newly created local price book**.
    

  ### Export Local Price Books

  - Converted prices are stored in XML files following the SFCC Price Book XML schema.
  - For each local price book, the job generates a corresponding XML file and exports it to the IMPEX directory, as defined by the `impexDirPath` parameter.


  ### Import Local Price Books into SFCC

  The `ImportPriceBook` job is used to import the generated local price books from the IMPEX directory into the SFCC Business Manager, making them available for use within the storefront or third-party platforms.

  In line with SFCC standards and the overall ESW cartridge design, product data is retrieved using the `ProductSearchModel`. This model only includes products that are both searchable and orderable.
  Any customizations required to include additional or non-standard product data must be implemented by the retailer.

## Scalability Recommendation

To ensure performance and scalability when working with large catalogs, ESW recommends generating localized price books in the PIM (Product Information Management system) and then importing them into Salesforce Commerce Cloud (SFCC) as read-only price books.

- This approach offers the following benefits:

- Reduces import time significantly

- Prevents performance bottlenecks during high-volume catalog processing

- Maintains consistency across external marketplaces and storefronts

## Why Localized Price Books Are Required

Most third-party marketplaces validate product pricing before allowing listings on their platforms. This validation process involves performing URL lookups of the product detail pages (PDP), where the marketplace scrapes product content—including the price—for accuracy. <br>

If prices are rendered dynamically using templates (e.g., calculated on-the-fly via ESW APIs at runtime), the marketplace cannot verify the pricing, and the product listing may be rejected.

Therefore, to ensure successful validation, it is highly recommended that retailers use localized price books, which:

- Contain pre-calculated final prices per market and currency

- Serve as a reliable source of truth for both storefront and marketplace feeds

- Guarantee pricing is available for non-interactive validation (without shopper session or currency detection logic)

### Additional Benefits

Beyond supporting third-party marketplaces, localized price books allow retailers to:

- Display accurate prices across regions

- Enable native features such as promotions, call-out messages, and other localized merchandising tools

- Improve shopper trust and conversion by maintaining consistent and transparent pricing

This feature is essential for retailers aiming to offer a seamless international experience and meet the technical requirements of global distribution channels.


## Exclude or Freeze Product Prices from Localized Price Books

This feature provides flexibility to either exclude specific products from localized price book generation for a given country or freeze existing product prices from being updated when running the latest `Pricing Advisor` calculations.

This is especially useful for:

- Maintaining manual price overrides

- Excluding non-sellable items in certain markets

- Preserving price integrity during automated updates

### How to Exclude or Freeze Product Prices

Follow the steps below to configure exclusions or freezes

::steps
  ### Navigate
  
  ****Merchant Tools → Products and Catalogs → Products**
    
  ### Locate

  Locate the product by entering its **Product ID** in the search.


  ### Make Changes

  Open and lock the product to make changes.

  ### ESW Configurations

  Under the ESW Configurations section, locate: <br>
 **List of countries where product price is not calculated**

 ### Enter ISO code

 Enter the **ISO code** of the country where the product price should be excluded or frozen.
 
 - To exclude from all localized price books, enter `All`.
 - To exclude from multiple countries, click Add another value and enter additional ISO codes.

 ### Apply changes

 Click :shortcut{value="Apply" size="md"} to save your changes.

After this configuration, the selected product will not qualify for the price calculation in the localized price book for configured localize countries.


## ESW Skip Localized Product Flag

The flag `eswSkipFlaggedLocalPrice` determines how freeze prices are incorporated into localized pricebooks. <br>

**`eswSkipFlaggedLocalPrice` set to `No` (default)**:

- If a localized pricebook already exists for the country:
- Prices for products with a freeze product price are retained from the previous localized pricebook. They are not recalculated based on PA data.
- Prices for products without a freeze product price are calculated based on their corresponding PA data.
- If there is no existing localized pricebook for the country:
  - Prices for products with a freeze product price are omitted from the generated pricebook.
  - Prices for products without a freeze product price are calculated based on their corresponding PA data.

**`eswSkipFlaggedLocalPrice` set to `Yes`**

- Prices for products with a freeze price are copied from the base pricebook into the localized pricebook. Only the currency is converted to match the localized currency.
- Prices for products without a freeze price are calculated based on their corresponding PA data.

## Bulk Products Restriction Management

You can update, delete, or change the value of countries for multiple products using any of the following two methods: <br>

- Bulk Update via Attributes in Business Manager

::steps
  ### Prepare XML File

  Create an XML file with the following structure:

  ```xml [Sample XML file]

    <product product-id="701642853695">
        <custom-attributes>
            <custom-attribute attribute-id=" eswProductPriceFreezeCountries">

                <value>SE</value>
            </custom-attribute>
        </custom-attributes>
