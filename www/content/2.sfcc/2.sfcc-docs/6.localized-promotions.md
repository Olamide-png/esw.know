The Localized Promotions feature provides an efficient way to manage international promotions for countries using the ESW Fixed Pricing Model. It allows retailers to automatically generate localized promotions using FX rates, reducing the manual effort required to create and maintain separate promotions for each market. <br>

This feature supports the following promotion types:

- With Amount of Qualifying Products

- Amount Off

- Fixed Price discounts


## Localized Promotion Configuration

The localized promotions functionality relies on the `eswRetailerLocalizedPromotions` job and a base XML file: `base_promotions.xml`.

Setup Steps

::steps{:level="5"}
  ##### :smart-icon{name="lucide:ticket-percent" size=20} Define Base Promotions

  - Create the base promotions in SFCC Business Manager using the base currency (e.g., USD).
  - Ensure these base promotions are correctly configured before exporting.

  ##### :smart-icon{name="lucide:circle-play" size=20} Run the Localized Promotions Job

  The `eswRetailerLocalizedPromotions` job takes the base promotions and generates localized versions using the appropriate **FX rates**, as defined by the **ESW Pricing Advisor**.

  ##### :smart-icon{name="lucide:file-up" size=20} Export and Apply Localized Promotions

  The job generates localized promotions for each configured currency (e.g., EUR, GBP, SEK) and applies them based on the shopper's selected currency or country.
::

##### Example Scenario

::alert{type="note" icon="lucide:test-tube"}
  If the base promotion is created in **USD**, the system can automatically generate:
  - A promotion in **EUR** for shoppers selecting Eurozone countries
  - A promotion in **GBP** for shoppers selecting the United Kingdom
  - A promotion in **SEK** for Sweden
::

When a shopper selects a specific country or currency at the storefront, the corresponding **localized promotion** is applied to the **qualified products**.
