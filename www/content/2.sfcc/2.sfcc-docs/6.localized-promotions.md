The Localized Promotions feature provides an efficient way to manage international promotions for countries using the ESW Fixed Pricing Model. It allows retailers to automatically generate localized promotions using FX rates, reducing the manual effort required to create and maintain separate promotions for each market. <br>

This feature supports the following promotion types:

- With Amount of Qualifying Products

- Amount Off

- Fixed Price discounts


## Localized Promotion Configuration

The localized promotions functionality relies on the `eswRetailerLocalizedPromotions` job and a base XML file: `base_promotions.xml`.

Setup Steps
