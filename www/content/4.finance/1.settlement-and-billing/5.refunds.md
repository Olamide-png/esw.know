## Refunds — Processing

The retailer may instruct ESW to refund any amount to the shopper outside the standard returns/cancellations process. Refunds will only be processed for items that have already shipped. If an item has not shipped, it must be refunded via the cancellation process.

### Process

::steps{:level="4"}
#### Submit Refund Request (CSP)
Retailer Customer Service submits the refund in the **ESW Customer Service Portal (CSP)**. This triggers a financial transaction. Refunds can be issued at **article (SKU) level** or for the **entire order**.

---

#### ESW Processing & Shopper Follow-up
**ESW** processes all refunds. If a refund attempt fails, ESW will **retry** or notify the retailer’s customer service to **contact the shopper** directly.

---

#### Settlement Reporting & Deductions
Refunds are included in the **settlement file (via email)**. **ESW** deducts the **full amount** of approved refunds from the retailer’s settlement.
