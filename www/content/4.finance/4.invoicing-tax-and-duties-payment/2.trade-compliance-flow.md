Trade compliance flow guides an order from cart to customs in six coordinated steps. At checkout, product data is normalized and classified :badge[Step 1-2]{type="info"}, pricing logic applies rounding and models :badge[Step 3]{type="warning"}, and duty/tax calculators return an accurate landed cost for the shopper :badge[Step 4]{type="success"}. After purchase, shipping and customs steps validate trade rules and documentation :badge[Step 5]{type="lime" class="align-middle mr-2"}, and the system issues compliant VAT invoices, credit notes, and receipts :badge[Step 6]{type="danger"}.
