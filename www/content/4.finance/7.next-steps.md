ESW’s onboarding is designed to be effortless and straightforward, targeting go-live in 6–8 weeks. The project runs in clearly defined phases `Scoping → Integration → Testing → Go-Live` with ESW and the retailer working in parallel.

- Scoping (Week 1–2): Define scope and timelines; align teams and environments.

- Integration (Week 2–5): Implement catalog & checkout hooks, package/ASN, and tracking endpoints; ESW begins Phase 2 while the retailer completes Phase 1 handover.

- Testing (Week 4–7): System Integration Testing, then Functional Testing, followed by User Acceptance Testing.

- Go-Live (Week 6–8): Final validations and production cutover.
