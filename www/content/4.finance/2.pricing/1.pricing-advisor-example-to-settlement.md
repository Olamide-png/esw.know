## Pricing Advisor — Example (UK)

- **Scenario:** Shopper is in the **UK**.  
- **FX rate (GBP/USD):** `0.9212`.  
- **Retailer uplift:** `+10%` applied to merchandise price in the UK.  
- **Duty & VAT at pre-order:** Exact values can’t be known at this stage (cart total and thresholds vary), so ESW uses a **blended (pseudo) rate** based on average cart size.  
  - **Blended duty:** `1.6%`  
  - **Blended VAT:** `20%`  
- **Rounding rule:** Prices are **rounded to the nearest £0.50**.

**Worked example:**
- Merchandise price: **$200**  
- Uplift (10%): **$20** → Subtotal: **$220**  
- Estimated duty (1.6% of $220): **$3.52**  
- Estimated VAT (20% of $220 + duty): **$44.70**  
- FX conversion to GBP at `0.9212` → **≈ £247.09**  
- **Rounded shopper price** (nearest £0.50): **£247.50**.

  ESW returns these components (uplift, estimated duty, estimated VAT, FX rate, rounding rule) per country; for the UK, the example above applies. The resulting price is passed to ESW via the **checkout API pre-order**.
