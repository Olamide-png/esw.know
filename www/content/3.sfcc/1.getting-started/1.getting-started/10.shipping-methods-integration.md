The shipping methods displayed on the ESW checkout depend on the **ESW Override Shipping** custom preference in the **ESW Checkout Configuration**.

- **When ESW Override Shipping is enabled** for a specific country:  
  - ESW shipping methods are **overridden** with standard **SFCC shipping methods**.  
  - The shipping method overrides are sent to ESW via the **Checkout API**.  
  - The SFCC shipping methods are displayed during checkout.  

- **When ESW Override Shipping is disabled** for a specific country:  
  - Shipping methods are retrieved from the **ESW tenant configuration**.  
  - These ESW shipping methods are displayed during checkout.


## Displaying the SFCC Shipping Methods

Standard **SFCC shipping methods** are created with a specific currency. In the **custom site preference**, each shipping method ID is mapped to a specific country.

### Steps

#title
Example

#description
**Name** and **Type** of each shipping method must be supported by ESW.   

#content
 - `POST` for standard shipping  
 - `EXP2` for express shipping 
---
The shipping method names must be either `POST` or `EXP2`. This naming rule is required by ESW. However, the ID can be any value. Configuring POST, EXP2, or any one of these two options for different currencies depends on the retailer’s business requirement.
