The localized promotions functionality relies on the `eswRetailerLocalizedPromotions` job and a base XML file: `base_promotions.xml`.

**Setup Steps**

::steps{:level="4"}

  #### :smart-icon{name="lucide:ticket-percent" size=20} Define Base Promotions

  - Create the base promotions in SFCC Business Manager using the base currency (e.g., USD).
  - Ensure these base promotions are correctly configured before exporting.

  #### :smart-icon{name="lucide:circle-play" size=20} Run the Localized Promotions Job

  The `eswRetailerLocalizedPromotions` job takes the base promotions and generates localized versions using the appropriate **FX rates**, as defined by the **ESW Pricing Advisor**.

  #### :smart-icon{name="lucide:file-up" size=20} Export and Apply Localized Promotions

  The job generates localized promotions for each configured currency (e.g., EUR, GBP, SEK) and applies them based on the shopper's selected currency or country.
::

##### Example Scenario
    
If the base promotion is created in **USD**, the system can automatically generate:
- A promotion in **EUR** for shoppers selecting Eurozone countries
- A promotion in **GBP** for shoppers selecting the United Kingdom
- A promotion in **SEK** for Sweden

When a shopper selects a specific country or currency at the storefront, the corresponding **localized promotion** is applied to the **qualified products**.

## Generating Localized Promotions

To generate localized promotions based on your base promotion configuration, follow the steps below:

::steps{:level="4"}

  #### :smart-icon{name="lucide:file-up" size=20} Export the Base Promotion

  - Navigate to **Merchant Tools → Online Marketing → Import & Export**
  - Select the promotion for which you want to generate localized versions and click `Next >>`

  #### :smart-icon{name="lucide:blocks" size=20} Define the Export File

  - In the Export file field, enter `base_promotions`
  - Click **Export** to generate the `base_promotions.xml` file.

  #### :smart-icon{name="lucide:folder-open" size=20} Upload to IMPEX Directory

  - Download the generated `base_promotions.xml` file.
  - Upload the file to the following path in the IMPEX directory `/RefArch` (or the appropriate Site ID)

  Example path: `Impex/src/ESW/promotions/RefArch/base_promotions.xml`

  #### :smart-icon{name="lucide:monitor-cog" size=20} Configure Localized Promotions Preference

  - Navigate to **Site Preferences → Custom Preferences → ESW Pricing Configuration**
  - Configure the **ESW Localized Promotions** preference, which stores the base promotion configuration required for localization

  #### :smart-icon{name="lucide:app-window" size=20} Execute the Localization Job

  - Import the `eswRetailerLocalizedPromotions` job from `salesforce-plugin\link_eshopworld\sitesdata`
  - After import, locate the job under **Administration → Jobs → eswInternationalPromotions**
  - Ensure the XML filename `base_promotions` is correctly referenced in the job script and stored in the appropriate promotions folder.

  Required file path: `Impex/src/ESW/promotions/RefArch/base_promotions.xml`

  #### :smart-icon{name="lucide:book-open-check" size=20} Verify the Output

  - Once the job has executed successfully, go to **Business Manager → Online Marketing → Promotions**
  - Confirm that the localized promotions have been created.

  Example:  
  If `Buy5for50` is the base promotion, you should see localized versions such as `Buy5for50_EUR`, `Buy5for50_GBP`, etc.
::

::alert{type="secondary" icon="lucide:info"}
  Note that the localized promotions are a replica of the base promotion uploaded to the IMPEX folder as `base_promotions.xml` (for example, for the `Buy5for50` promotion).
