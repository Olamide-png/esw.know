## Import Metadata

**Metadata** includes both system and custom objects required to enable the ESW integration.

::tabs{variant="line"}
  ::div{label="System Objects" icon="lucide:computer"}
  **System objects** are core SFCC components that define standard platform functionalities. They include the essential data structures required for the site’s basic operation, such as:
    - Countries  
    - Currencies  
    - Shipping methods  
  ::

  ::div{label="Custom Objects" icon="lucide:card-sim"}
  **Custom objects** enable business-specific configurations that extend the capabilities of SFCC. They provide flexibility to support additional capabilities, such as:
   - Tenant credentials  
   - Pricing Advisor settings
  ::
::

Together, these objects form the **metadata**, which defines the operational framework of SFCC.
