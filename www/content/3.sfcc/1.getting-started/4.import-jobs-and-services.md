**Jobs** and **services** enable automation and real-time communication between SFCC and ESW.

- **Jobs** – Execute scheduled tasks such as price updates or order exports.  
- **Services** – Handle API interactions to ensure real-time data exchange between SFCC and ESW.

These components work together to automate processes like order processing, data synchronization, and pricing updates.

### Steps to import

Follow these steps to import the job and service configuration files included in the ESW package:

::steps{:level="4"}

#### :smart-icon{name="streamline-ultimate-color:folder-upload" size=50 class="align-middle mr-2"} Navigate to Import & Export

Navigate to **Administration → Operations → Import & Export**

---

#### :smart-icon{name="streamline-ultimate-color:common-file-upload" size=50 class="align-middle mr-2"} Upload ESW Package Files

- From the **ESW package**, upload:
  - **Jobs XML file**
  - **Services XML files**

The jobs file initializes automated tasks that maintain key aspects of the system, such as order processing and data synchronization.  
Similarly, services enable SFCC to communicate with external systems in real time.
