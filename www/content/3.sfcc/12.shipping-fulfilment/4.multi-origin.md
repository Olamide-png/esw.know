**Multi-Origin Shipments** is a logistics solution that enables retailers to dispatch products from **multiple fulfillment locations or warehouses** within a single order.

This approach:
- Optimizes shipping rates and Estimated Delivery Dates (EDD)
- Enables faster deliveries by splitting shipments
- Promotes sustainability by prioritizing local fulfillment centers and reducing carbon footprint

## How to Test

Verify that products **without a fulfilment country** cannot be added to the basket.

#### Steps

1. Open a **PDP** for a product that does **not** have a fulfilment country
2. Click **Add to Basket**
3. Verify that the product is **not added** to the basket

#### Screenshot Message Snippet

```text
Sorry, "Flat Front Pant" cannot be added to the cart as it is unavailable for delivery to the selected country at the moment.

### Case 2: Order With Products That Have Fulfilment Countries

Verify that products with fulfilment countries create **separate delivery options**.

#### Steps

1. Open the storefront
2. Open a PDP for a product **with** a fulfilment country
3. Add the product to the basket
4. Add another product with a **different fulfilment country**
5. Proceed to checkout
6. Review the **Delivery Options** section

#### Expected Behaviour

- The checkout displays **multiple delivery methods**
- Each delivery method corresponds to a different fulfilment country
- Products are grouped by origin and shipped separately

#### Screenshot Behaviour Summary

Your order will arrive in multiple packages.
```

Example delivery breakdown:
```text
