## Self-Hosted Order Confirmation Page

The ESW cartridge supports **self-hosted order confirmation**, allowing retailers to choose where shoppers are redirected after a successful ESW checkout.

In **Salesforce Commerce Cloud (SFCC)**, retailers can configure either a custom path on their storefront or an external URL as the order confirmation page.

---

## Feature Configuration

Follow the steps below to enable and configure the self-hosted order confirmation page.

1. Go to **Merchant Tools → Site Preferences → Custom Preferences**
2. Select the **ESW Checkout Configuration** preference group
3. Locate the custom preference **ESW Enable Order Confirmation Success Page**
4. Set the value to:
   - **Yes** — to enable the feature  
   - **No** — to disable the feature
5. Set **ESW Order Confirmation Success URL** to one of the following:

### URL Configuration Options

#### A. Controller or Route Path
Examples:
- `EShopWorld-OrderConfirm`
- `checkout/confirmation`

#### B. Absolute URL
Example:
- `https://orderconfirmurl.com`

#### C. Empty Value (Default Behaviour)

If left empty, the ESW cartridge automatically generates the confirmation URL based on the storefront type:

##### SFRA
```
https://storefronturl.com/EShopWorld-OrderConfirm?orderId={orderID}
```

##### SiteGenesis (SG)
```
https://storefronturl.com/EShopWorldSG-OrderConfirm?orderId={orderID}
```

##### PWA
```
https://storefronturl.com/checkout/confirmation/{orderID}
```

> **Note:**  
> Ensure the PWA storefront URL is configured in:  
> **Merchant Tools → Site Preferences → Custom Site Preference Groups → ESW PWA Integration Configuration**

##### Headless
```
https://storefronturl.com/checkout/confirmation/{orderID}
```

> **Note:**  
> Ensure the headless storefront URL is configured in:  
> **Merchant Tools → Site Preferences → Custom Site Preference Groups → ESW Headless Integration Configuration**
