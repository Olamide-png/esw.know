      <p>
        The <strong>ESW Customs Catalog API</strong> allows you to share your product catalog with ESW.
      </p>

      <p>
        A product catalog is a list of all products that you want to sell and includes details, such as product code,
        product description, prices, HS code, and so on.
      </p>

      <p>
        Providing catalog details is a crucial step in the integration flow because:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
        <li>It allows for an accurate calculation of the duties &amp; taxes at the checkout.</li>
        <li>It also ensures compliance with the international trade regulations and faster customs clearance, directly impacting delivery timeframes and shopper experience.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The Customs Catalog API is asynchronous and it contains a <code class="text-sm text-pink-600">POST</code> method that allows you to make an API request detailing the catalog items to be created in the ESW database.
        You can make a full catalog upload request if you are sharing your product data with ESW for the first time (generally during onboarding).
        If you have partially updated your catalog—for instance, if you have added new products that you want to sell internationally—you can send only the new catalog items in the API request.
        After you submit the API request, the ESW system validates the request and returns the appropriate response code.
