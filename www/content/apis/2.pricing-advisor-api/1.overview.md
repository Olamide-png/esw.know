### Pricing Advisor API

The Pricing Advisor API is a robust tool designed to empower you with dynamic pricing data for various countries. It allows you to retrieve the pricing data for the delivery countries from the ESW system. You can use the retrieved data to calculate product prices in the shopper currency by applying our pricing formula. It provides essential information such as foreign exchange rates, estimated duties, taxes, and retailer adjustments, all crucial for setting competitive and accurate prices at checkout.

You can benefit from the API’s daily updated FX rates from trusted sources, ensuring they have the most current data for pricing decisions. The API also offers flexibility with rounding models, allowing you to control how you want to round prices for display.

This API is particularly beneficial as it helps you plan your pricing models to adapt to different markets, ensuring compliance with local tax and duty requirements, and ultimately, optimising profit margins while maintaining competitive pricing. It’s a strategic asset for anyone looking to streamline their pricing strategy and expand their market reach with confidence.
