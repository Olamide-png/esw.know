    The <span class="text-teal-600 font-semibold">ESW Pricing Advisor API</span> allows you to retrieve pricing data for countries where you want to sell your products. This data helps determine how you want to price your products and display them at the checkout.
  </p>

  <p>
    Using the Pricing Advisor API, you can retrieve pricing data for a specific delivery country or for all countries where ESW delivers. The information you can retrieve includes:

  <ul role="list" class="list-disc marker:text-teal-400 pl-6 space-y-1">
    <li>FX Rates</li>
    <li>Estimated Duties</li>
    <li>Estimated Taxes</li>
    <li>Retailer Adjustments</li>
    <li>Rounding Models</li>
  </ul>

  <strong class="block mb-1 text-sky-600 dark:text-sky-300 font-semibold">Note:</strong>
  FX rates are updated daily based on the price feed that you specify during your onboarding.
  ESW offers three pricing feeds â€“ <span class="font-medium">HSBC</span>, <span class="font-medium">XE</span>, or <span class="font-medium">Thomson Reuters</span>.<br />
  The rates for the <span class="font-medium">estimated duties & taxes</span>, <span class="font-medium">retailer adjustment</span>, and <span class="font-medium">rounding models</span> are also agreed upon during your onboarding with ESW.
