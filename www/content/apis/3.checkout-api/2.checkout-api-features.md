### Sales Assisted Checkout Tracking

<section class="space-y-4 text-sm text-neutral-800 dark:text-neutral-200">
  <p>
    When checkouts are manually created by the sales assistants for the shoppers, 
    ESW's <span class="font-medium">Sales Assisted Checkout Tracking</span> feature identifies which sales assistant assisted the shoppers.
    As a result, you have the ability to track such sales and the sales assistants who drove those sales.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are some <span class="font-medium">mandatory</span> and <span class="font-medium">optional</span> parameters you need to send to ESW to leverage this capability.
