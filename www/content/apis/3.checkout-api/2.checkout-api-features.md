### Sales Assisted Checkout Tracking

<section class="space-y-4 text-sm text-primary dark:text-primary-foreground">
  <p>
    When checkouts are manually created by the sales assistants for the shoppers, 
    <span class="font-medium">ESW's Sales Assisted Checkout Tracking</span> feature identifies which sales assistant assisted the shoppers.
    As a result, you have the ability to track such sales and the sales assistants who drove those sales.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are some <span class="font-medium">mandatory</span> and <span class="font-medium">optional</span> parameters you need to send to ESW to leverage this capability.
