## Sync order and item-level cancellations

::steps
### Bi-directional Sync of Order and Item-Level Cancellations

Ensure that cancellations—whether for entire orders or individual items—are synchronized in both directions between Shopify and ESW. When a cancellation occurs in either system, update the corresponding order or item status in the other system to maintain consistency and accurate order management.
