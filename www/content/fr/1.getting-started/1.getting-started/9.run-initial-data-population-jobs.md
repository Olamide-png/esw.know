To finalize the setup, execute the key jobs that initialize essential data within SFCC. You can manually run a job from **Business Manager** to trigger specific backend processes as needed.


## Execute a job

::steps{:level="4"}

#### :smart-icon{name="streamline-ultimate-color:cog-hand-give-1" size=50 class="align-middle mr-2"} Access Jobs  

Navigate to **Administration → Sites → Operations → Jobs**

---

#### :smart-icon{name="streamline-ultimate-color:monitor" size=50 class="align-middle mr-2"} Run the Job  

- Select the desired **job** from the list.
- Click **Run**.
- If the job is in **edit mode**, click **Run Now** instead.

### Key Jobs

::tabs{variant="line"}
  ::div{label="Pricing Feed Job" icon="lucide:hand-coins"}
  ### Pricing Feed Job (`eswRetailerPricingFeed`)
  The `eswRetailerPricingFeed` job makes API calls to the retailer pricing feed and stores the retrieved data in a **custom object**. This data includes:
  
  - FX rates  
  - Country adjustments  
  - Duties and taxes per country  

  **Important behavior:**
  - The API call is **skipped** if the current day matches the day listed in the job’s preference.  
  - The `ESW_PA_DATA` custom object is updated **only once per day**.  
  - No further API calls are made for the remainder of that day.

  ::div{label="Auto-Configurator" icon="lucide:settings"}
  ### Retailer Auto-Configured Job (`eswRetailerAutoConfigurator`)
  The `eswRetailerAutoConfigurator` job creates **country** and **currency** custom objects based on Pricing Advisor data stored in the `ESW_PA_DATA` custom object.

  **Prerequisite:**  
  The `eswRetailerPricingFeed` job must run successfully **before** executing this job to ensure that the necessary pricing data is available.

  **Recommended schedule:**  
  Run **bi-weekly** or **monthly**, or manually after a **country expansion**.
  ::

  ::div{label="Verify Results" icon="lucide:list-checks"}
  ### Verifying the Results
  After running these jobs:

  1. Navigate to **Merchant Tools → Custom Objects → Custom Object Editor**  
  2. Locate the `ESW_COUNTRIES` object.  
  3. Select the countries supported by ESW and define the applicable pricing models.

### Optional Manual Configuration

Manual updates may be required for the following scenarios

::tabs{variant="line"}
  ::div{label="Base Currency" icon="lucide:coins"}
  ### Base Currency
  If the base currency differs from the site’s default, it should be configured accordingly.
  ::

  ::div{label="Pricing Model" icon="lucide:calculator"}
  ### Pricing Model
  By default, the pricing model is **dynamic/calculated**.  
  To switch to a **fixed** pricing model, check **'is Fixed Price Model'** in the country’s custom object.

  _For more details, see **ESW Pricing Integration**._
  ::

  ::div{label="Non-supported Countries" icon="lucide:globe-2"}
  ### Non-supported countries
  Any country not supported by ESW must be added manually by the retailer.
