The cartridge supports two pricing models offered by ESW:

- **Fixed Pricing**
- **Calculated Pricing**
::




You can configure these pricing models **per country** through **SFCC Business Manager**.

  title: Fixed Pricing
  icon: streamline-ultimate-color:cash-payment-coin-dollar
  icon-size: 50
  ---
  A Fixed pricing model is a localized price that is not dynamically converted based on real-time foreign exchange (FX) rates. This price is taken directly from the standard price books in Salesforce B2C Commerce and used as-is.
  ::

  ::card
  ---
  title: Calculated Pricing
  icon: streamline-ultimate-color:monetization-tablet-dollar
  icon-size: 55
  ---
  The Calculated Pricing Model derives localized prices dynamically by converting a retailer’s **default price book value** using a structured pricing formula. <br>
  This approach enables flexible and real-time pricing for different countries.

  The Hybrid Pricing Model combines both Fixed and Calculated Pricing strategies. It allows for a base fixed price to be set, while also enabling dynamic adjustments based on real-time market conditions and FX rates.

  ### Conditions for Using Fixed Pricing Model
  - Configure in Site Preferences: `ESW Fixed List PriceBook Pattern`, `ESW Fixed Sale PriceBook Pattern`.
  - Matching Fixed Price Books must exist and include valid product price assignments.
  - Books considered for fixed pricing must be **active** and **indexed**.

  ### Requirements

  #### Single Fixed Price Display
  Shown when:
  - Only one fixed price exists (list or sale), **or**
  - Only one Fixed Price Book is configured and it has a valid price assignment.

  **Fallback:** If no fixed price is found, show `null` / `N/A`.

  #### Site Assignment Restriction
  Fixed Price Books must **not** be assigned to any Site (assigned books are treated as regular price books and excluded from fixed rendering).

  #### Currency and Price Book Setup
  - Add non-default currencies in SFCC for in-country fixed prices.
  - Orders are stored using that currency.
  - Welcome Mat currency selection disabled; default comes from **ESW Countries**.
  - Enable **Is Fixed Price Model** on the country.

    The Localized Price Books feature allows you to generate country-specific price books by applying **FX rates, retailer uplifts, estimated duties, taxes**, and **rounding rules** provided by the **ESW Pricing Advisor**. <br>

    Once generated, the final localized product prices are compiled into price books that can be **exported to external marketplaces**, enabling more targeted promotions, flexible shipping options, and improved conversion rates for international shoppers.

    ## `eswRetailerLocalizedPricing`

    The `eswRetailerLocalizedPricing` job is responsible for converting product prices into localized values and exporting them. It works in conjunction with the ESW Localized Pricing Countries custom preference to perform the following tasks:

    ::steps{:level="4"}
    #### :smart-icon{name="streamline-ultimate-color:app-window-bookmark" size=50 class="align-middle mr-2"} Assign Converted Prices to Local Price Books
    
    - **If a local price book already exists**:
        - The job converts all prices from the base price book to local prices using the relevant FX rate, country-specific uplifts, and rounding rules.
        - The updated prices are assigned to the existing local price book.
    - **If a local price book does not exist**:
        - The job performs the same price conversion process and assigns the resulting prices to a **newly created local price book**.
        

    #### :smart-icon{name="streamline-ultimate-color:folder-upload" size=50 class="align-middle mr-2"} Export Local Price Books

    - Converted prices are stored in XML files following the SFCC Price Book XML schema.
    - For each local price book, the job generates a corresponding XML file and exports it to the IMPEX directory, as defined by the `impexDirPath` parameter.


    #### :smart-icon{name="streamline-ultimate-color:sd-card-download" size=50 class="align-middle mr-2"} Import Local Price Books into SFCC

    The `ImportPriceBook` job is used to import the generated local price books from the IMPEX directory into the SFCC Business Manager, making them available for use within the storefront or third-party platforms.
    ::

    ::alert{type="secondary" icon="lucide:info"}
    In line with SFCC standards and the overall ESW cartridge design, product data is retrieved using the `ProductSearchModel`. This model only includes products that are both searchable and orderable.
    Any customizations required to include additional or non-standard product data must be implemented by the retailer.
    ::

    ## Scalability Recommendation

    To ensure performance and scalability when working with large catalogs, ESW recommends generating localized price books in the PIM (Product Information Management system) and then importing them into Salesforce Commerce Cloud (SFCC) as read-only price books.

    - This approach offers the following benefits:

    - Reduces import time significantly

    - Prevents performance bottlenecks during high-volume catalog processing

    - Maintains consistency across external marketplaces and storefronts

    ## Why Localized Price Books Are Required

    Most third-party marketplaces validate product pricing before allowing listings on their platforms. This validation process involves performing URL lookups of the product detail pages (PDP), where the marketplace scrapes product content—including the price—for accuracy. <br>

    If prices are rendered dynamically using templates (e.g., calculated on-the-fly via ESW APIs at runtime), the marketplace cannot verify the pricing, and the product listing may be rejected.

    Therefore, to ensure successful validation, it is highly recommended that retailers use localized price books, which:

    - Contain pre-calculated final prices per market and currency

    - Serve as a reliable source of truth for both storefront and marketplace feeds

    - Guarantee pricing is available for non-interactive validation (without shopper session or currency detection logic)

    ### Additional Benefits

    Beyond supporting third-party marketplaces, localized price books allow retailers to:

    - Display accurate prices across regions

    - Enable native features such as promotions, call-out messages, and other localized merchandising tools

    - Improve shopper trust and conversion by maintaining consistent and transparent pricing

    This feature is essential for retailers aiming to offer a seamless international experience and meet the technical requirements of global distribution channels.


    ## Exclude or Freeze Product Prices from Localized Price Books

    This feature provides flexibility to either exclude specific products from localized price book generation for a given country or freeze existing product prices from being updated when running the latest `Pricing Advisor` calculations.

    This is especially useful for:

    - Maintaining manual price overrides

    - Excluding non-sellable items in certain markets

    - Preserving price integrity during automated updates

    ### How to Exclude or Freeze Product Prices

    Follow the steps below to configure exclusions or freezes

    ::steps{:level="4"}
    #### :smart-icon{name="streamline-ultimate-color:e-commerce-touch-buy" size=50 class="align-middle mr-2"} Navigate
    
    **Merchant Tools → Products and Catalogs → Products**

    #### :smart-icon{name="streamline-ultimate-color:barcode" size=50 class="align-middle mr-2"} Locate

    Locate the product by entering its **Product ID** in the search.


    #### :smart-icon{name="streamline-ultimate-color:dial-finger-1" size=50 class="align-middle mr-2"} Make Changes

    Open and lock the product to make changes.

    #### :smart-icon{name="streamline-ultimate-color:cog-hand-give-1" size=50 class="align-middle mr-2"} ESW Configurations

    Under the ESW Configurations section, locate: <br>
    **List of countries where product price is not calculated**

    #### :smart-icon{name="streamline-ultimate-color:file-code-check" size=50 class="align-middle mr-2"} Enter ISO code

    Enter the **ISO code** of the country where the product price should be excluded or frozen.
    
    - To exclude from all localized price books, enter `All`.
    - To exclude from multiple countries, click Add another value and enter additional ISO codes.

    #### :smart-icon{name="streamline-ultimate-color:mouse-smart" size=50 class="align-middle mr-2"} Apply changes

    Click :shortcut{value="Apply" size="md"} to save your changes.
    ::

    ::card

    img: /image-20210620-181515.png
    --- 
    ::

    After this configuration, the selected product will not qualify for the price calculation in the localized price book for configured localize countries.


    ## ESW Skip Localized Product Flag

    The flag `eswSkipFlaggedLocalPrice` determines how freeze prices are incorporated into localized pricebooks. <br>

    **`eswSkipFlaggedLocalPrice` set to `No` (default)**:

    - If a localized pricebook already exists for the country:
    - Prices for products with a freeze product price are retained from the previous localized pricebook. They are not recalculated based on PA data.
    - Prices for products without a freeze product price are calculated based on their corresponding PA data.
    - If there is no existing localized pricebook for the country:
    - Prices for products with a freeze product price are omitted from the generated pricebook.
    - Prices for products without a freeze product price are calculated based on their corresponding PA data.

    **`eswSkipFlaggedLocalPrice` set to `Yes`**

    - Prices for products with a freeze price are copied from the base pricebook into the localized pricebook. Only the currency is converted to match the localized currency.
    - Prices for products without a freeze price are calculated based on their corresponding PA data.

    ## Bulk Products Restriction Management

    You can update, delete, or change the value of countries for multiple products using any of the following two methods: <br>

    - Bulk Update via Attributes in Business Manager
    - Bulk update via XML Import.

    When using Localized Price Books in SFCC, it's important to understand the resource constraints associated with each Salesforce Commerce Cloud realm.Salesforce allocates limited hardware resources per realm, and running long-duration jobs—such as generating localized price books for hundreds of thousands of SKUs across multiple local markets—can significantly impact SFCC performance. This may lead to:
    - System slowdowns
    - Job timeouts
    - Resource deadlocks
    

    ### Recommendations

    - Assess Suitability Before Enabling
    - Before enabling the localized price book feature, review the following:
    - Number of active SKUs in your catalog
    - Number of localized markets/currencies supported
    - SFCC performance and job processing statistics

    - Use Dynamic Pricing for Large Catalogs
    For retailers managing large product catalogs across many regions, the dynamic pricing model is recommended. In this model, prices are calculated at runtime during template rendering, reducing the load on batch job infrastructure.

    - Enable Read-Only Price Books
    If product prices are not being managed directly within SFCC, ESW strongly recommends using read-only price books to optimize performance.
    - Read-only price books significantly reduce price book import time
    - Ideal for scenarios where pricing is managed externally (e.g., in a PIM or external feed)

    To enable read-only price books: Navigate to:`Administration → Global Preferences → Feature Switches` <br>
    Activate the Read-Only Price Book setting under the Feature Switches section.

    ::div{label="Localized Promotions" icon="lucide:badge-cent"}

    The localized promotions functionality relies on the `eswRetailerLocalizedPromotions` job and a base XML file: `base_promotions.xml`.

    Setup Steps

    ::steps{:level="5"}
    ##### :smart-icon{name="lucide:ticket-percent" size=20} Define Base Promotions

    - Create the base promotions in SFCC Business Manager using the base currency (e.g., USD).
    - Ensure these base promotions are correctly configured before exporting.

    ##### :smart-icon{name="lucide:circle-play" size=20} Run the Localized Promotions Job

    The `eswRetailerLocalizedPromotions` job takes the base promotions and generates localized versions using the appropriate **FX rates**, as defined by the **ESW Pricing Advisor**.

    ##### :smart-icon{name="lucide:file-up" size=20} Export and Apply Localized Promotions

    The job generates localized promotions for each configured currency (e.g., EUR, GBP, SEK) and applies them based on the shopper's selected currency or country.
    ::

    ##### Example Scenario

    ::alert{type="note" icon="lucide:test-tube"}
    If the base promotion is created in **USD**, the system can automatically generate:
    - A promotion in **EUR** for shoppers selecting Eurozone countries
    - A promotion in **GBP** for shoppers selecting the United Kingdom
    - A promotion in **SEK** for Sweden
    ::

    When a shopper selects a specific country or currency at the storefront, the corresponding **localized promotion** is applied to the **qualified products**.

    ## Generating Localized Promotions

    To generate localized promotions based on your base promotion configuration, follow the steps below:

    ::steps{:level="5"}
    ##### :smart-icon{name="lucide:file-up" size=20} Export the Base Promotion

    - Navigate to **Merchant Tools → Online Marketing → Import & Export**
    - Select the promotion for which you want to generate localized versions and click `Next>>`

    ##### :smart-icon{name="lucide:blocks" size=20} Define the Export File

    - In the Export file field, enter `base_promotions`
    - Click **Export** to generate the ``base_promotions.xml file`.

    ##### :smart-icon{name="lucide:folder-open" size=20} Upload to IMPEX Directory

    - Download the generated `base_promotions.xml` file.
    - Upload the file to the following path in the IMPEX directory `/RefArch` (or the appropriate Site ID)

    Example path `Impex/src/ESW/promotions/RefArch/base_promotions.xml`

    ##### :smart-icon{name="lucide:monitor-cog" size=20} Configure Localized Promotions Preference

    - Navigate to **Site Preferences → Custom Preferences → ESW Pricing Configuration**
    - Configure the **ESW Localized Promotions** preference, which stores the base promotion configuration required for localization

    ##### :smart-icon{name="lucide:app-window" size=20} Execute the Localization Job

    - Import the `eswRetailerLocalizedPromotions` job from the location `salesforce-plugin\link_eshopworld\sitesdata`
    - After import, locate the job under **Administration → Jobs → eswInternationalPromotions**
    - Ensure the XML filename `base_promotions` is correctly referenced in the job script and stored in the appropriate promotions folder.

    Required file path `Impex/src/ESW/promotions/RefArch/base_promotions.xml`

    ##### :smart-icon{name="lucide:book-open-check" size=20} Verify the Output

    - Once the job has executed successfully, go to **Business Manager → Online Marketing → Promotions**
    - Confirm that the localized promotions have been created.

    Example <br>
    If `Buy5for50` is the base promotion, you should see localized versions such as `Buy5for50_EUR`, `Buy5for50_GBP`, etc.
