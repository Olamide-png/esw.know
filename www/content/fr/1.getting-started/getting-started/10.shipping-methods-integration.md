---

The shipping methods displayed on the ESW checkout depend on the **ESW Override Shipping** custom preference in the **ESW Checkout Configuration**.

- **When ESW Override Shipping is enabled** for a specific country:  
  - ESW shipping methods are **overridden** with standard **SFCC shipping methods**.  
  - The shipping method overrides are sent to ESW via the **Checkout API**.  
  - The SFCC shipping methods are displayed during checkout.  

- **When ESW Override Shipping is disabled** for a specific country:  
  - Shipping methods are retrieved from the **ESW tenant configuration**.  
  - These ESW shipping methods are displayed during checkout.


## Displaying the SFCC Shipping Methods

Standard **SFCC shipping methods** are created with a specific currency.  
In the **custom site preference**, each shipping method ID is mapped to a specific country.

### Steps
1. Navigate to **Merchant Tools → Ordering → Shipping Methods**
2. Create the shipping methods with:
   - **Shipping names**  
   - **Types** for currencies available to shoppers in the storefront
3. Ensure that the **name** and **type** of each shipping method are supported by ESW.

The shipping method names must be either `POST` or `EXP2`. This naming rule is required by ESW. However, the ID can be any value. Configuring POST, EXP2, or any one of these two options for different currencies depends on the retailer’s business requirement.

4. Configure the shipping method IDs for the country. You can configure the IDs in a JSON format using the ESW Override Shipping custom site preference in ESW Checkout Configuration. 

5. If you want to display ESW shipping override methods on the cart page, then please enable custom preference ESW Hide Native Shipping in the ESW Retailer Display Configuration.

Once configured, the shipping methods are displayed at the checkout for the country. The following screenshot shows the shipping methods configured for Ireland.

## Verification on the Storefront

After completing the configuration, verify the following:

### Currency and Pricing
Ensure currency and pricing display correctly on:
- **Product Display Page (PDP)**
- **Product Listing Page (PLP)**
- **Cart Page**

### ESW Storefront Components
Confirm that ESW storefront components reflect the new configuration:
- **Header**
- **Footer**
- **Country Selector** widget

Once pricing data is converted and supported countries are selected, the storefront is ready for validation.
