## Key Jobs

::tabs{variant="line"}
  ::div{label="Pricing Feed Job" icon="lucide:hand-coins"}
  ### Pricing Feed Job (`eswRetailerPricingFeed`)
  The `eswRetailerPricingFeed` job makes API calls to the retailer pricing feed and stores the retrieved data in a **custom object**. This data includes:
  
  - FX rates  
  - Country adjustments  
  - Duties and taxes per country  

  **Important behavior:**
  - The API call is **skipped** if the current day matches the day listed in the job’s preference.  
  - The `ESW_PA_DATA` custom object is updated **only once per day**.  
  - No further API calls are made for the remainder of that day.

  ::div{label="Auto-Configurator" icon="lucide:settings"}
  ### Retailer Auto-Configured Job (`eswRetailerAutoConfigurator`)
  The `eswRetailerAutoConfigurator` job creates **country** and **currency** custom objects based on Pricing Advisor data stored in the `ESW_PA_DATA` custom object.

  **Prerequisite:**  
  The `eswRetailerPricingFeed` job must run successfully **before** executing this job to ensure that the necessary pricing data is available.

  **Recommended schedule:**  
  Run **bi-weekly** or **monthly**, or manually after a **country expansion**.

  ::div{label="Verify Results" icon="lucide:list-checks"}
  ### Verifying the Results
  After running these jobs:

  1. Navigate to **Merchant Tools → Custom Objects → Custom Object Editor**  
  2. Locate the `ESW_COUNTRIES` object.  
  3. Select the countries supported by ESW and define the applicable pricing models.
