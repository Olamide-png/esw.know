## Import Metadata

**Metadata** includes both system and custom objects required to enable the ESW integration.

- **System objects** are core SFCC components that define standard platform functionalities.  
They include the essential data structures required for the site’s basic operation, such as:
  - Countries  
  - Currencies  
  - Shipping methods  

- **Custom objects** enable business-specific configurations that extend the capabilities of SFCC.  
They provide flexibility to support additional capabilities, such as:

  - Tenant credentials  
  - Pricing Advisor settings  

Together, these objects form the **metadata**, which defines the operational framework of SFCC.
