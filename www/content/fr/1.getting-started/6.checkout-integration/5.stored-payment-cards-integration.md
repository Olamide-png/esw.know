The ESW Stored Payment Cards feature allows logged-in shoppers to securely save their payment card details, enabling a faster and smoother checkout experience on future purchases.

## Key Benefits

- **Accelerated Checkout Experience:** Shoppers can complete purchases quickly using previously saved cards, reducing friction at checkout.

- **Increased Conversion Rates:** Faster checkout is a proven method to boost shopper conversion, leading to higher revenue for retailers.

- **Enhanced Shopper Satisfaction:** Repeat shoppers benefit from a convenient experience, which builds brand loyalty and encourages repeat purchases.

- **Effortless Integration:**  This is a plug-and-play feature built on the standard SFCC plugin, requiring minimal integration effort from the retailer.

Stored Payment Cards Integration

Workflow between the ESW-SFCC plugin/cartridge, ESW Checkout, and ESW Payments
::


## Workflow Assumptions

The Stored Payment Cards feature operates under the following conditions:

- The shopper is already logged in to their account.

- The checkout process is executed in a secure (HTTPS) context.

- Both the retailer’s site and the ESW checkout are hosted under the same top-level domain (TLD) to ensure secure and seamless card storage and retrieval.


### Stored Payment Cards – Shopper Workflow

::steps{:level="4"}

#### :smart-icon{name="streamline-ultimate-color:shopping-cart-full" size=55} Shopper Adds Item to Cart  

- The shopper adds a product to the cart and clicks the **Checkout** button.


#### :smart-icon{name="streamline-ultimate-color:sd-card-sync" size=55} Authentication Check  

- If the shopper is not already logged in, they are presented with:
  - **Forced Login**, or
  - **Guest Checkout** (if enabled)

::alert{type="secondary" icon="lucide:lightbulb"}
**Note:** Stored card functionality is only available to **logged-in shoppers**.
::


#### :smart-icon{name="streamline-ultimate-color:e-commerce-apparel" size=55} Order Creation in SFCC  

- After login, the **ESW SFCC Plugin** creates a new order in SFCC.  
- The order status is set to `Created`.


#### :smart-icon{name="streamline-ultimate-color:e-commerce-touch-buy" size=55} Pre-Order Request Assembly  

- The plugin extracts the `registeredProfileId` and builds the **pre-order payload**.  
- This payload is submitted to the **ESW Checkout API** to initiate the ESW checkout experience.


#### :smart-icon{name="streamline-ultimate-color:app-window-code" size=55} ESW Checkout API Response  

- On success, the response returns:
  - A **Checkout URL** for shopper redirection.
  - A **shopper access token** (`shopperAccessToken`) to be stored as a browser cookie using the key:  
    **`esw-shopper-access-token`**


#### :smart-icon{name="streamline-ultimate-color:file-code-check" size=55} Handling the Access Token in SFCC  

- The plugin checks for the access token:
  - If present, it sets a **browser cookie** using the domain from the **ESW Top-Level Domain** preference.
  - If absent, the shopper is still redirected to the ESW Checkout URL.


#### :smart-icon{name="streamline-ultimate-color:wireless-payment-credit-card-dollar" size=55} ESW Checkout – Payment Panel Logic  

- On reaching the **Payment Panel**, the ESW Checkout:
  - Reads the `esw-shopper-access-token` from the cookie.
  - Validates the token.
  - Makes a **server-to-server call** to the ESW Payment API to fetch stored cards.


#### :smart-icon{name="streamline-ultimate-color:credit-card-1" size=55} Stored Card Selection  

- If valid stored cards are returned:
  - The shopper sees a **dropdown menu** listing their saved payment methods.
  - The shopper can select a card and proceed to **complete the checkout**.

## Cookie Details – esw-shopper-access-token
The esw-shopper-access-token cookie is required to authenticate the shopper and enable the stored payment card feature on ESW Checkout.

### Cookie Attributes

| Attribute   | Description                                                          |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**    | `esw-shopper-access-token`                                           |
| **Max-Age** | Inherits from the SFCC platform’s native session expiration settings |
| **Domain**  | `{your checkout domain}` (e.g. `mycheckoutdomain.com`)               |
| **Secure**  | `true` (must be set for HTTPS usage)                                 |

The domain can be configured using `Business Manager → ESW Checkout Configuration → ESW Top Level Domain`

### Sample HTTP Header

```pgsql
Set-Cookie: esw-shopper-access-token=abcdef; Secure; Domain=mycheckoutdomain.com; Max-Age=3600
```

### Cookie Creation Strategy

#### Non-Headless Architecture (SFRA / SiteGenesis)

The cookie is automatically created by the ESW SFCC plugin during checkout flow.

#### Headless Architecture

Headless storefront developers must manually implement cookie creation on the client side, using the values specified above.

> The ESW SFCC plugin cannot control client-side cookie creation in headless environments.

## First-time and Repeat Shopper Experience

First-time shoppers are prompted to save the cards for later use

## Options for Testing in Sandbox and Staging Environment

To test the Stored Payment Cards feature in a sandbox or staging environment, you have two options

::card-group
  ::card
  ---
  title: Option 1 Matching Top-Level Domains
  icon: streamline-ultimate-color:app-window-two
  icon-size: 60
  ---
  Ensure that the top-level domain is the same for both the SFCC testing instance and the ESW Checkout. This allows the esw-shopper-access-token cookie to be set and read correctly, enabling the stored cards feature without additional configuration.
  ::

  ::card

  title: Option 2 Manually Set Cookie (Mismatched Domains)
  icon: emojione:cookie
  icon-size: 60
  ---
  If the top-level domains differ between your SFCC instance and the ESW Checkout (e.g., .sfccsandbox.com vs. .eswcheckout.com), the cookie must be added manually for testing.
  ::
::  

### Steps to Test with Manual Cookie Setup

Use the following steps when testing the Stored Payment Cards feature in a sandbox environment where top-level domains differ between SFCC and ESW Checkout

::steps{:level="4"}

#### :smart-icon{name="emojione:cookie" size=55} Verify Cookie Creation in SFCC Domain  

- Begin the checkout process as a **logged-in shopper**.
- After initiating checkout, open **Developer Tools** in your browser.
- Navigate to:  
  **Application → Storage → Cookies**
- Confirm that the cookie **`esw-shopper-access-token`** has been created under your SFCC top-level domain.

Domain: ``zyfl-001.dx.commercecloud.salesforce.com``

#### :smart-icon{name="emojione:shopping-cart" size=55} Redirect to ESW Checkout  

- Continue the checkout flow until the shopper is redirected to the **ESW Checkout** page.


#### :smart-icon{name="emojione:cookie" size=55} Manually Update Cookie Domain  

- In **Developer Tools**, go to:  
  **Application → Storage → Cookies**
- Locate and **copy** the `esw-shopper-access-token` value from the SFCC domain.
- Create a new cookie entry for the ESW Checkout domain (e.g., `.eshopworld.com`) using the following fields:

| **Field** | **Value** |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Name**  | `esw-shopper-access-token` |
| **Value** | *(paste the copied token)* |
| **Domain** | `.eshopworld.com` |
| **Secure** | `true` |
| **Max-Age** | `3600` *(1 hour, or as needed)* |

#### :smart-icon{name="streamline-ultimate-color:wireless-payment-credit-card-dollar" size=55} Refresh the ESW Checkout Page  

- Reload the **ESW Checkout** page in the browser.
- The **Stored Cards** payment option should now appear and be available for selection.
