## Overview

This feature extends the capabilities of Salesforce Commerce Cloud (SFCC) by enabling you to create dynamic, localized front-end experiences for your customers. Below is a breakdown of the key points:

- The ESW cartridge integrates seamlessly with the Page Designer module in SFCC.
- This integration allows you to easily design and customize storefront pages, enhancing the overall shopping experience for their customers.
- By leveraging the ESW cartridge, you gain access to additional features and functionalities that extend beyond SFCC’s default capabilities.

### Localized Front-End Prices:

- A primary benefit of this integration is the ability to display localized front-end prices.
- You can create dynamic pricing displays tailored to different regions, currencies, and languages.
- When designing pages with the Page Designer, you can add components to display prices in the customer’s preferred currency.
- These localized prices are automatically converted based on exchange rates or other business rules.

For example, when a shopper in Japan views a product, the ESW cartridge automatically converts the base price into Japanese Yen (JPY) and displays it on the product page.

> The ESW cartridge seamlessly integrates localized pricing with SFCC Page Designer, enabling retailers to deliver a personalized, region-specific shopping experience. Whether using SFRA or SiteGenesis, this integration ensures customers worldwide see accurate and relevant prices in their local currency.
