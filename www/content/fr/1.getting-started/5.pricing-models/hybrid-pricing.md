The Hybrid Pricing Model combines both Fixed and Calculated Pricing strategies. It allows for a base fixed price to be set, while also enabling dynamic adjustments based on real-time market conditions and FX rates.
::

The Hybrid Pricing Model derives localized prices by combining a retailerâ€™s **default price book value** with dynamic adjustments (FX, uplift, duties, taxes) when rules require it.
