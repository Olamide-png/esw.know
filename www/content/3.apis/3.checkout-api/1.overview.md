The ESW Checkout API allows for a seamless checkout experience for shoppers. It sends cart information including shopper and retailer configuration details to the ESW Checkout system.

The Checkout API returns a unique redirect URL that leads the shopper to the Checkout UI, where they can review the order and enter the shipping, billing, and payment details. The Checkout API also supports features such as shipping override, order discounts, promotional codes, and registered shoppers.
