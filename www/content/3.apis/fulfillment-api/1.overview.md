## Overview

The ESW Fulfillment APIs provide a set of structured, RESTful integration endpoints that replicate standard EDI-based fulfillment data flows between retailers and third-party logistics (3PL) systems. These APIs enable the automated, real-time exchange of catalog, inventory, order, and shipment data across platforms—ensuring consistency, transparency, and scalability for global operations.

While each API corresponds to an EDI transaction type (e.g., `832`, `846`, `850`), the implementation is fully API-first, providing modern payload formats (typically JSON) and transport mechanisms optimized for performance and reliability.

## API Functional Overview

### 1. Inventory Update – `EDI 846`
Provides real-time inventory visibility. The 3PL’s system updates stock levels, locations, and availability through this API, allowing retailers to ensure product listings reflect accurate availability.

### 2. Order Creation – `EDI 850`
Initiates fulfillment by transmitting customer order details from the retailer to the 3PL. Payloads include order items, quantities, customer and shipping data, and any special handling instructions.

### 3. Order Validation /Acknowledgement  – `EDI 855`
Communicates acceptance or rejection of an order following validation by the 3PL. Enables the retailer’s system to handle partial fulfillment or restocking scenarios before shipment begins.

### 4. Order Shipped – `EDI 856  / Package API`
Sends shipment confirmations back to the retailer once an order has been picked, packed, and dispatched. Provides tracking numbers, carrier details, and package-level shipment data to support downstream customer notifications.

## Integration Purpose

These APIs establish a unified, scalable fulfillment backbone managed by ESW. They standardize communication across the entire order lifecycle, reduce manual synchronization, and enable multi-node, cross-border operations with the precision and efficiency required for global commerce.
