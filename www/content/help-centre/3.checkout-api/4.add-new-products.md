### Add new products to the existing catalog

This scenario applies if you have already shared your product catalog with ESW during onboarding and now want to add new products to the catalog. For instance, if you have added new product types, such as handbags or seasonal merchandise to your catalog.

For all such scenarios, instead of sending the full catalog upload request containing new as well as old items, you can send only the new catalog items in the API request.

### Request Example

The following payload shows the delta catalog upload request. If you want to update just one or multiple products in the catalog, you must send a request for each product - be it a minimum catalog upload request or a full catalog upload.

```json [Required Example] height=150 collapse
