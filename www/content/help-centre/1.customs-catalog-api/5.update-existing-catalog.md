### Update existing catalog

This scenario applies if you have already shared your product catalog with ESW during onboarding and want to update just one or multiple products already existing in the catalog. For instance, if you want to update the gender details for a product, or if you want to update the product category for multiple products, and so on.

For all such scenarios, you must send the full request for the product. If the request is successful, any field that was populated previously in the database is overwritten with the new product data.

### Request Example

The following payload shows parameters that must be sent for all full catalog upload requests.

```json [Required Example] height=150 collapse

     {
       "productCode": "11160296020014",
