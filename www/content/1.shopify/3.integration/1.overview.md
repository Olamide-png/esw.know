### Summary

Integration leverages Shopifyâ€™s native checkout to handle the shopper purchase flow. After a shopper completes checkout on Shopify, the resulting order is imported into ESW as an Offline order. This approach allows ESW to assume responsibility for downstream processes, including:

- Logistics and shipping orchestration
- Compliance
- Order tracking and post-purchase workflows
