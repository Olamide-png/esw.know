### Order Management – Shopify (Webhook Integration)

This process enables seamless order handling between Shopify and ESW, ensuring that orders, fulfillment updates, and cancellations are synchronized in real time.

`Shopify → Webhook → ESW (Order Import) ↔ Fulfillment/Shipping ↔ Order Updates/Cancellations`
