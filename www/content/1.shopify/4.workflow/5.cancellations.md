### A. Order-Level Cancellations

#### 1. Shopify to ESW

When an order is cancelled in Shopify, the cancellation is sent to ESW through the Cancel Order API, ensuring both platforms remain synchronized.

---

#### 2. ESW to Shopify

When ESW cancels an order, the update is communicated to Shopify using the GraphQL `orderCancel` mutation, so both systems display the same order status.

### B. Item-Level Cancellations

#### 1. Shopify Item Cancellations

Cancelling specific items in Shopify triggers the ESW Item Cancel API, updating ESW.

---

#### 2. ESW Item Cancellations

When ESW cancels individual items, Shopify is updated using the `refundCreate` API.
