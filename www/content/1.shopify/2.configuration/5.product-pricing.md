## Managing Product Pricing

You can manage how prices are displayed in your storefront using one of the following options:

1. **Use ESW Pricing Advisor:** Automatically display ESW Duty & Tax (D&T) inclusive prices across product pages for landed cost pricing.

2. **Set Fixed Prices in Shopify:** Manually configure fixed product prices for each market directly within Shopify.

## Managing Exchange Rates in Shopify

Shopify enables you to sell in multiple currencies by managing exchange rates through automatic or manual conversions.

### Manual Exchange Rate Conversions

With manual exchange rates, you can stabilize pricing and avoid market fluctuations by setting fixed rates for each market.

- Manual rates can be set for all markets except your primary market.

- Rates are based on your store’s base currency and can include the conversion fee.

- Manual rates apply only to products without international fixed prices.

- You can combine manual exchange rates with price adjustments to fine-tune pricing for each market.

**To activate a manual exchange rate:**
