When automatic redirection is enabled, shoppers are automatically redirected to the storefront that best matches their location preferences (e.g., country, language, or currency).

This ensures:

- A localized shopping experience tailored to the shopper’s region.

- Automatic display of the appropriate storefront without requiring manual selection.

## Markets Using Dedicated Domains

When a market is configured with its own domain, subdomain, or subfolder, the country/region redirection feature automatically detects the customer’s geolocation and redirects them to the corresponding market URL.

### Example

- **US Market:** `example.com`

- **Canada Market:** `example.ca`

If a Canadian customer visits example.com, they are automatically redirected to `example.ca`.

### SEO Behavior

For markets using dedicated domains, the localized content is automatically indexed by search engines, improving discoverability and SEO performance for each market-specific storefront.

## Markets Using Shared Domains

When a market shares the same domain as another market, the country/region redirection feature automatically detects the customer’s geolocation and adjusts the storefront content dynamically. This includes updates to currency, language, and other localized elements without changing the domain.

### Example

- **Primary Market:** United States – `USD` – `example.com`

- **Secondary Market:** Canada – `CAD` – using the same domain (`example.com`)

When a Canadian customer visits `example.com`, product prices and other content are automatically displayed in `CAD`.

### SEO Behavior

For markets using shared domains, localized content is not indexed separately by search engines, as all markets operate under the same domain.

## Country/Region Redirection in the European Union (EU)

To comply with EU legislation, customers from the European Union who access a localized storefront with a **country-code top-level domain (ccTLD)** are not automatically redirected. This ensures shoppers remain on the store they intentionally visited.

### Behavior

1. If a market uses a country-specific domain (e.g., `.de` for Germany or `.fr` for France):
  - A French customer visiting example.de will not be automatically redirected to `example.fr`.

2. If a market uses a non-country-specific domain (e.g., `.com`, `.shop`):
  - EU customers can be automatically redirected based on their location.

### Optional Enhancement

To improve the user experience, you can install a third-party app from the Shopify App Store.
  - These apps display country/region recommendations, allowing EU shoppers to manually select their preferred store for the correct language and location.

### EU Country Code Top-Level Domains (ccTLDs)

Use the list below to identify the specific ccTLDs for EU countries:

| Country        | ccTLD |
| -------------- | ----- |
| Austria        | `.at` |
| Belgium        | `.be` |
| Bulgaria       | `.bg` |
| Croatia        | `.hr` |
| Cyprus         | `.cy` |
| Czech Republic | `.cz` |
| Denmark        | `.dk` |
| Estonia        | `.ee` |
| Finland        | `.fi` |
| France         | `.fr` |
| Germany        | `.de` |
| Greece         | `.gr` |
| Hungary        | `.hu` |
| Ireland        | `.ie` |
| Italy          | `.it` |
| Latvia         | `.lv` |
| Lithuania      | `.lt` |
| Luxembourg     | `.lu` |
| Malta          | `.mt` |
| Netherlands    | `.nl` |
| Poland         | `.pl` |
| Portugal       | `.pt` |
| Romania        | `.ro` |
| Slovakia       | `.sk` |
| Slovenia       | `.si` |
| Spain          | `.es` |
| Sweden         | `.se` |
| European Union | `.eu` |


## Language Redirection

Language redirection automatically detects the customer’s browser language and switches the storefront to the matching language, if it’s available.

### Requirements

For language redirection to work:
  - The language must be added to your store.
  - It must be assigned to the relevant markets.
  - Translations must be added for store content.
  - The language must be published.

### Example

- **Domain:** `example.ca`

- **Default Language:** English

- **Shopper’s Browser Language:** French

When language redirection is enabled:
  - The shopper is automatically redirected to `example.ca/fr`,
  - The storefront is displayed in French for a localized experience.
