You can add a new location in Shopify to manage inventory, fulfillment, and shipping more effectively.

### Behavior of New Locations

- Inventory is automatically made available for online purchases at each newly created location.

- Once created, you can activate delivery methods for the location.

- The new location is added to the bottom of your fulfillment priority list.

::alert{icon="lucide:info"}
  By default, new products are stocked at all locations. You can adjust inventory levels from Products > Inventory, selecting a location, and editing variants. For large updates, use the bulk editor or CSV imports. You can't remove all stock from locations that have pending orders or transfers.
