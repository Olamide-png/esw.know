## Add a Market in Shopify

To tailor your store for customers in a particular country or region, add a new market from the Markets page in your Shopify admin. 
When you add a new market, Shopify may suggest recommended markets based on stores similar to yours. These recommendations highlight countries or regions where you are likely to find success, using data from merchants with the same primary market.

## Create a Market in Shopify

If your new market does not have a parent market, it will be created with your store’s default settings and no customizations. If you assign a parent market, the new market will automatically inherit the customizations from the parent market.
