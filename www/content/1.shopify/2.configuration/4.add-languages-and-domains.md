## Managing Languages

You can manage and configure multiple storefront languages directly from your Shopify Admin:

- **Languages Section:** Add, edit, and maintain all languages available in your store.

- **Markets Section:** Assign specific languages to each market to deliver a localized shopping experience for different regions.

## Considerations for Managing Languages

When managing languages and translations for your Shopify store and markets, keep the following in mind:

::tabs
  ::div{label="Multi-Language Requirements" icon="streamline-ultimate-color:network-browser"}
  Ensure your store is eligible and meets the requirements for selling in multiple languages.
  ::

  ::div{label="Theme & Checkout Support" icon="noto:shopping-cart"}
  Adding a language automatically provides translations only for **supported themes and checkout flows**.  
  For other store content, you’ll need to import translations or use a translation app.
  ::

  ::div{label="Translations" icon="streamline-ultimate-color:messages-bubble-square-typing-1"}
  When adding a new language:
  - You must have translations ready **or**
  - Install and configure a translation app (e.g., Translate & Adapt) and assign the language to a market.
  - Translation apps can also be found in the Shopify App Store.
  ::

  ::div{label="Publishing Without Translations" icon="streamline-ultimate-color:messages-bubble-square-subtract"}
  If you publish a language without uploading translations:
  - Shopify prompts you to add translations.
  - Only theme and checkout translations will display; other content remains untranslated.
  ::

  ::div{label="Domains Requirement" icon="streamline-ultimate-color:network-signal"}
  To manage languages per market, you must have international domains configured.  
  Without international domains, language settings are shared across all active markets.

## Manage Languages for Markets

In Shopify, you can add, manage, and set default languages for each market through the Markets section of your admin panel.


### Prerequisites

- You must configure international domains using subfolders, domains, or subdomains to manage languages per market.

- Without international domains:
 - Language settings are shared across all active markets.
 - You cannot configure language settings for individual markets.

### Add a Language to a Market

::alert{type="note" icon="lucide:pencil"}
  Before you can assign a language to a specific market, you must [add the language](/shopify/configuration/add-languages-and-domains#add-a-language-to-your-online-store).
