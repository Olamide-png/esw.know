When automatic redirection is enabled, shoppers are automatically redirected to the storefront that best matches their location preferences (e.g., country, language, or currency).

This ensures:

- A localized shopping experience tailored to the shopperâ€™s region.

- Automatic display of the appropriate storefront without requiring manual selection.

## Markets Using Dedicated Domains

When a market is configured with its own domain, subdomain, or subfolder, the country/region redirection feature automatically detects the customerâ€™s geolocation and redirects them to the corresponding market URL.

### Example

- **US Market:** `example.com`

- **Canada Market:** `example.ca`

If a Canadian customer visits example.com, they are automatically redirected to `example.ca`.

### SEO Behavior

For markets using dedicated domains, the localized content is automatically indexed by search engines, improving discoverability and SEO performance for each market-specific storefront.

## Markets Using Shared Domains

When a market shares the same domain as another market, the country/region redirection feature automatically detects the customerâ€™s geolocation and adjusts the storefront content dynamically. This includes updates to currency, language, and other localized elements without changing the domain.

### Example

- **Primary Market:** United States â€“ `USD` â€“ `example.com`

- **Secondary Market:** Canada â€“ `CAD` â€“ using the same domain (`example.com`)

When a Canadian customer visits `example.com`, product prices and other content are automatically displayed in `CAD`.

### SEO Behavior

For markets using shared domains, localized content is not indexed separately by search engines, as all markets operate under the same domain.

## Country/Region Redirection in the European Union (EU)

To comply with EU legislation, customers from the European Union who access a localized storefront with a **country-code top-level domain (ccTLD)** are not automatically redirected. This ensures shoppers remain on the store they intentionally visited.

### Behavior

1. If a market uses a country-specific domain (e.g., `.de` for Germany or `.fr` for France):

 - A French customer visiting example.de will not be automatically redirected to `example.fr`.

2. If a market uses a non-country-specific domain (e.g., `.com`, `.shop`):

 - EU customers can be automatically redirected based on their location.

### Optional Enhancement

To improve the user experience, you can install a third-party app from the Shopify App Store.

- These apps display country/region recommendations, allowing EU shoppers to manually select their preferred store for the correct language and location.
