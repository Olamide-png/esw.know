## Managing Languages

You can manage and configure multiple storefront languages directly from your Shopify Admin:

- **Languages Section:** Add, edit, and maintain all languages available in your store.

- **Markets Section:** Assign specific languages to each market to deliver a localized shopping experience for different regions.

## Considerations for Managing Languages

When managing languages and translations for your Shopify store and markets, keep the following in mind:

‚úÖ **Meet Multi-Language Requirements:** Ensure your store is eligible and meets the requirements for selling in multiple languages.

üåê **Theme and Checkout Support:** Adding a language automatically provides translations only for supported themes and checkout flows. For other store content, you‚Äôll need to import translations or use a translation app.

üìù **Providing Translations**: When adding a new language:

1. You must have translations ready or
2. Install and configure a translation app (e.g., Translate & Adapt) and assign the language to a market.
3. Translation apps can also be found in the Shopify App Store.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Publishing Without Translations**: If you publish a language without uploading translations:
 1. Shopify prompts you to add translations.
 2. Only theme and checkout translations will display; other content remains untranslated.

üåç **International Domains Requirement**: To manage languages per market, you must have international domains configured. Without international domains, language settings are shared across all active markets.

## Manage Languages for Markets

### Prerequisites

- Without international domains:
 - Language settings are shared across all active markets.
 - You cannot configure language settings for individual markets.
